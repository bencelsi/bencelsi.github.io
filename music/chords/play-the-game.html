Every morning
Gm7       Bbm6        Am7`
I've been feeling far away
Dm7      Bb∆7            (Gm7 C7)`
I’ve got things to do and bills to pay / plans to make

F∆7    Dm7`
I’d forgotten
Bb       Dm Gm       A7    Dm`
But then my eyes are wide awake

Going over how you used to say

              G∫7`
Just like the way it used to be
Eb   	(Bb-Eb)`
So glad

And in the moment I am not afraid

A∆7   D∆7`
Oh my darling
Bm7       Bm7b5            C#m7`
I’ve been feeling all this weight
F#m7                       Bm7         Bm7/E`
I’ve been calling you like every day

A|E           F#m|C#m`
Something’s rotten
Bm7  F#m7 C#m7    C#m7b5 F#7∫ Bm6`
(but) Then my   mind is wide   a    wake
Bm7      C#m7              Bm7            Bm7/E`
Don’tcha know the truth is yours to make

F#∆7        F#∆7  Abm7       F#|C#`
(Every day) Every day, a new sound
F#|C#      Bbm7    Ebm7`             
You can be what you choose to be

So glad…

For that…
Cm7 Fm7add9`
Know that…
Cm7  Fm7/Bb`
It’s alright

Gm7        Cm7             Fm7`
Now in the morning I won’t run away
  C#7              Am7`
I want to play the game
Em7        Am7      Dm7`
Taking the football all of the way

Dm6/C#  C∆7  F∆7`
Fall in love

I’m in love, love
