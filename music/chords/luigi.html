C                        Dm7             G  `
A long time ago when the world was still new
Dm7      G    C    `
Everyone knew Luigi
C                      Dm7             G   `
All of our stories and myths will come true
Dm7           G    C    `
Here’s one to you, Luigi


C     G    Am    `
Luigi went biking
Dm        G           C`
He took a path that’s winding
C            G    Am`
The winds of fate behind him
Dm        G         C`
He wasn’t scared of dying


C                Dm7          G`
Hey there Luigi, what did you do
Dm7           G     C`
Keep your aim true, Luigi
C                Dm7          G`
When is one life worth a thousand or two?
Dm7        G    C`
It’s up to you, Luigi


C               G         Am`
The eyes of the world are shining
Dm         G      C`
Footage we keep rewinding
C               G         Am`
The wheel turns, a man is dying
Dm         G      C`
Why does this feel exciting?


C                Dm7           G`
Hey there Luigi, what have you done
Dm7            G    C`
Now you’re the one, Luigi
C                    Dm7          G    `
Look at the progress technology’s brung
Dm7            G    C      G7`
Print your own gun, Luigi


C           G             Am     `
His bullets engraved with writing
    Dm    G         C          `
The media finds him frightening
C              G      Am         `
We all want to do the right thing
Dm           G    C        `
Sometimes we need reminding


C                Dm7          G `
Hey there Luigi, what did you do
      Dm7         G    C      `
They’re looking for you, Luigi
C                       Dm7          G  `
Is this what all of our systems come to?
Dm7          G   C    `
What will we do, Luigi


C                 G       Am      `
Through arches of gold, a sighting
Dm               G        C       `
They brought him in still fighting
C      G      A      `
I feel stars aligning
Dm      G      C     `
Divided minds uniting


C                     Dm7          G   `
Written in blood is a story that’s true
   Dm7           G     C    `
In red white and blue, Luigi
C                       Dm7           G  `
Death and rebirth and a hash brown or two
Dm7           G    C     `
Here’s one to you, Luigi!
