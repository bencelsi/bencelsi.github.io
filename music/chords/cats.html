(Intro)
Cm7   C#m7 Dm7`

Dm7   G7   C∆7   Am7`
Dm7   G7   C∆7   Am`

Dm7                 G`
I don’t really like talking to people...
           C∆7                          Am7`
My cat she tells me they’re evil and the people tell me that I am crazy
Dm7              G`
Talking cats are nothing new
                 C∆7                 Am`
And soon they’re telling me what to do

Dm7                  G7`
I wanna stop I wanna stop her from talking
                  C∆7                           Am7`
She’s always gotta say every little thing that she is thinking in her head
Dm7                        G         G7`
She doesn’t like it when i try to go walking
           Em        Em7         A7∫4      A7`
And lately something out there’s trying to tell me

Bm7          C#m7      Em7          F#m7`
Drive to the beach and take a look around you
C#m7             B        E7              F#m`
Something’s been looking, now it's almost found you
        Bm7           C#m7 C#7  F#m7          A7`
And you roll down the win- dow, everything is better  now

D     B       E7           F#m7   Bm7`
And I feel so crazy when I figure out
Bm7/E
Ahhhh

V2
Dm7                   G7`
Now I’m walkin down avenues talking to people
C∆7               Am7`
Thinking about a lot of things
              A7            Dm7`
But then it’s time to go to school

Dm7                   G`
I wanna walkthrough but the hallways too small to
             C∆7                     Am`
I’m getting stuck on the little swing

Dm7                   G`
It’s not enough it’s not enough to keep talking
                  C∆7                           Am7`
You always gotta say every little thing that you are thinking in your head

Dm7                  G G7`
I wanna stop I wanna stop it from blocking
    Em       Em7    A7sus4    A7`
But someones always trying to tell me

C2a
Bm7          C#m7      Em7     F#m7`
Run down the street and take a look around you
C#m7        B       E7             F#m`
Something’s been looking now it’s almost found you

Bm7 C#m7 Ebm7 Em7`
And your mind starts to wander, now you’re in a car now
C#m7        D    A  Dm6            C#m7
You make me feel so crazy when you call me (ahh!)

Bm7       C#m7       D        E`
You came along and I feel your smile for me

A          C#m7  Cm7  Bm7          F#7`
And in the night when it's far too dark to see

Bm7           C#m7      Bm7           C#m7`
Drive to the beach and stay until the morning
Bm7           C#m7         G      E`
 If it gets cold and pray for global warming
