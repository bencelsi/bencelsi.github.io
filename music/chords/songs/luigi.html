A long time ago when the world was still new

Everyone knew Luigi

All of our stories and myths will come true

Here’s one to you, Luigi

Verse 1``
C     G    Am`
Luigi went biking
Dm        G           C`
He took a path that’s winding

The winds of fate behind him

He wasn’t scared of dying

The eyes of the world are shining
Dm         G      C`
Footage we keep rewinding
C               G         Am`
The wheel turns, a man is dying

Why does this feel exciting?

Now you’re the one, Luigi

Look at the progress technology’s brung
Dm7            G    C      G7`
Print your own gun, Luigi

Verse 3``
C           G             Am`
His bullets engraved with writing
    Dm    G         C`
The media finds him frightening!

We all want to do the right thing

Sometimes we need reminding

Is this what all of our systems come to?
Dm7          G   C`
What will we do, Luigi

Verse 4``
C                 G       Am`
Through arches of gold, a sighting
Dm               G        C`
They brought him in still fighting
C      G      A`
I feel stars aligning
Dm      G      C`
Divided minds uniting

Chorus 4``

Written in blood is a story that’s true
   Dm7           G    C`
Red white and blue, Luigi

Death and rebirth and a hash brown or two

Here’s one to you, Luigi
