Bm`
Fifteen minutes… Essay due in fifteen minutes
Bm         Bbm`
Any minute I'll begin it
Bm                 G7 F#7`
Fourteen minutes
Bm`
This is grating... I'm waiting for this fog to start abating
                         Am`
But I’m so much a pro at crastinating
Bm               C7 B7`
So Frustrating


Em`
Egads gadzooks dagnabbit! This is so bad I wanna smack a rabbit! 
                              C#m`
I'm smack dab in it with this cyclic habit
Em                  C7 B7`
Bout ta stab shit
Em                Eb+`
It's not my fault things have piled up
G                C#o7                        C7`
Why, the pileups high 'nough I'm, uh, kinda riled up
F#m7                                  B7`
And meanwhile while time winds down I will wind up with...
Em`
Thirteen minutes


Em      C         G C`
I can't take it
     G           D   G`
This workload is too much
            B7`
Sometimes I wish I wasn't full IB 'cause
                                 Em`
Well, because I wouldn't have to do much


      C       Eb       F          Ab`
Eight courses coursing through my veins
  C        Eb       F     G`
A curse is curdling in my brains
   C         Am        Dm         G`
My course of course contains this chore
      Ab        Bb    C`
Which shakes me to my I.B. core
    C       Eb      F            Bb`
The crooked ways to get straight A's
    C        Eb        F      F#`
All nighters make nightmarish days
   C          Am     Dm      G`
To pass class I need CAS? My ass!
   Ab     G        Ab      G       Ab       G        C`
My last resort’s a crass retort, a torte of sorts of sass, alas


A           D           G            B`
Why do us die hard try hards try hard?
F      C       Ab      C#`
Why do I heart hurting my heart?
A      D       G      B`
Why oh why are triers ripe
   F       C    B         E`
To buy the IB’s righteous hype? (Then gripe ‘bout sky-high piles of tripe?)


E     A       D    B`
Oh, I be full of full I.B.
  E    A     Bb    B`
I.e. I.B. be all I see
C    F        G   Em`
E.E. I.A. ‘n’ T.O.K.
  Am  C   F G A`
P.A.R.A.N.O.I.A


(Organ Solo!)
A     Abm7  F#m7  C#m7 `
F∆7   C∆7   B     Em`


   C                  D`
If I’d have been more forthright
  G                  E`
I might have had the foresight
           Am                          D`
But now my courseload’s a horseload of horse shite
        B7`
And I'm losing my grasp on the grip on the grades that I've
                          Em`
Fought for for forty four fortnights


C       Am D         Bm             G             F#+    E`
However…     My I.B. tether I could never sever
E           E7          Am                        F`
‘Cause if I did however would I ever, know I was clever
        Dm                                 E                B7       E`
Without withstanding standing up to this morose endeavor forever and ever...


    E            A      D         F#`
And though these queasy sprees be sleazy
C             G       Eb   Ab`
Geez, they’re breezy, easy peasy!
    E               A           D            F#`
And being the bee’s knees, with ease, if you please
   C           G                   F#             B`
I appease as I squeeze, tease, nay seize A’s from B’s!


   B       Bb    A    Ab       G   F#      F    E`
So no it’s not a platitude, my attitude is gratitude...


Em`
Time to write quite tight, aight, try to write white, right,
Fm`
Right to the wire Imma tirelessly tire, ire,
F#m`
Ire is my fire this is dire, I’ll expire, I are,
Gm`
Mired in mire, unadmired, tightly wound while highly wired,
Abm`
Wily, rightly wiry, really, wisely weary, dreary, worried
Am`
Hurried, flurried, scurried, buried, curried, purely, surely tired
Bbm`
I wind up with...
Bm`
<i>Zero minutes</i>
