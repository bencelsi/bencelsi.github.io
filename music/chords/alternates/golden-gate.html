Oh let’s get outta town
F#            F#6            Abm7     Bm6 (alt: Bb∫7 Bb7)
Across the sky , 
95 along the shoulder
Magenta sky over your shoulder
City’s fire behind
Makin time along the border
Fire winds along the border
City sky 


C1a
    A        F#m
And now it’s sinkin in it

I know it’s gone
D   C#m  F#m    G     A7
And all along I know, o-oh no- / And all I’ll ever know
D   Bm             Em
The sun is sinking low

And you'll never even know…

V2a
A         F#m7
This is getting bad

I wanna slip into the ocean

I wanna swim into the ocean

V3 Solo   -or V2b instead??
F#   Ebm7
On a holiday
Abm7   Bm6  Bbm7 Ebm7  
You’re on a holiday





V2
Actually unchanged, like 1st verse!
New higher melody though - pretty good 2.m4a - chords are inevitable , melody is umanity scrambling to climb out of inevitablity
Key of F# (could be E ? or C#)

Guess its pretty good,
You’re rollin now
You all I c
Brief pool section - orange glow
Bm6? 
Eventually pulsating, leads into C1’
Or after V2?


C1a
    Bb        Gm
And now it’s sinking in
Ab Bb         Eb
I know you’re gone
Ab     Dm    C#m      C     E7
You’re all I want, I know, o-oh no-

You know I love you so / And I don’t want to go / It’s hard to let you go / Don’t wanna go

Golden Gate (Just Lyrics)

I don’t wanna wait
I saw the golden gate
Slowly slip into the ocean

Now it’s falling down / something’s calling now
Oh let’s get out of town
Hit the road see the sunset (ahhh)

And now it’s sinking in / drink it in
I know you’re gone / mow the lawn

You’re all I want, I know / and all along, i know
Oh, oh

The sun is sinking low
But I don’t want to go
And you’ll never even know


Think of mom and dad
And all the fun we had

Think of being a kid
And all the things we did


••••••••••••••••••••••••••


Something’s changing now

V2a
C#      Bbm7  	
Rain is pouring down    
Ebm7         F7     (slight pitch shift)
I think I’m gonna drown
Bb Gm Cm F7∫  4 F7
I wanna swim into the ocean

V1b
Bb        Gm7add4add9     (melody F# Ab A)
Found a paddle board
Cm7          D      D7 	
The water struck a chord
G        Em7                Am7 Cm6
On the sail you see your shadow

It stayed the same before


The shadows start to grow
And I don’t wanna know


F#   Ebm7
I don’t wanna wait
Abm7                         Bb7 (slight pitch shift)
I want a holiday
Eb    	Cm          	Fm  	Bb7∫4   Bb7
I saw you swimming in the ocean
Eb 	Cm7 
As you swim along
Fm7          G
You start to sing a song
C Am7 Dm7 Fm6
But I can’t hear you underwater


And now I’m getting sad
