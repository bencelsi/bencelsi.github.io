ROUND AND AROUND
TODOS: Rerecord vocals
Musically strong, but has no perspective, no identity.  About too many things. Pretentious sounding vocals.
If you dont know what the songs about, its probably about you. Get 

Around pain im feeling now around lonelinesss
Round and around
Ive heard this 
About aimless ghost


Mild high club - esque 
This song is here to hypnotize, lyrics

BASS AND DRUM GROVE EVERY BAR MUST BE SATISFYING EACH TIME! ITS THE DOPAMINE HIT .DISTINGUISH IT AS A SECTIONSOMEHOW…

ASSOCIATED SOUND EFFECT:
faint clock tick
Sound of wind
Rain - hi freq,  stuttered to form scratchlike like groove?

Big picture: Song has a hypnotic effect… slowly building
Way it builds is like shifts in the wind, not just adding in a new part each time


Strictly loops, not many bridges… 
Production Ideas

‘Sparkle’ - some hi eq sounds on piano, grow over time
Ocean - EQ and volume tied together somehow , rushes and waves bring in new instruments
Breathe-  utilize breath sounds. Also whole production breathes

•••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••
Unsure how to start… fade in

Eventually - song morphs into trying to fully hypnotize

C#maj7 Amaj7 
And youre always falling down

And its always falling down

REAL VERSE w NEW MELODY
I found myself
Out on a railway track
Its coming back again and again
I wanna move ah but my legs are slack 
And I can’t go back again 
And you told me 

OR, ADD LEO HERE??? New voice

LYRICS


Round and around
I’ve seen this wave before


Times 

Round and around
About a ghost and a clock - the terror of the passing of time - But its time to come around

who goes round and round
All the walls are are upside down

I’ve sang this verse before
And you always hangin round
Im holding out for more
Oh round  


Epic chord
Fm7/C|C# …Bb/F

M: chromatically down from Ab
(now in the park i thought we were done)
Lush jazz harmony over kickin’ beat - empty guitars chugging

Instrumental


Idea - Try to use all keys, or just modular up half step
Has:
A B Ab E D F# C#
Doesn’t
C Eb F G Bb
