<h1>Ode to Oden
<img src="../../gif/basketball_walk.gif" style="margin: auto;"></h1>
I wrote this, Greg Oden, for I owe it to you.
My anecdotal ode is odd but true...
Oden, you're a hero, a modern day Jesus.
You save us from poverty, war and diseases.
The trails that you blaze are both tough and forebodin',
Yet you glow as you wade through these roads, oh Greg Oden.
Oden, oh Oden, you're Earth's last Eden,
Like a sweaty sweet chocolate from Boden, Sweden.
I know that Greg's leg broke, I saw it was bleedin'.
Wheeled off on a stretcher, you were coughin' and wheezin',
A good enough reason to leave for the season?
I swear I was cryin', the day you were dyin',
But you would be brave, like a powerful lion.
Haters, traitors, and alligators,
They hate your traits, but these are just allegations.
They say that you're ugly, lookin' old for your age,
I tell them you're spicy, like parsnip and sage
Rosemary, these things just improve over time
Twenty-two, but you look like a fine forty-nine
Year old.  Damn!  Man oh man, how I wish you were mine,
Part Obama, part Jesus, and part Frankenstein.

I miss you, Greg Oden, I wish I could kiss you
Those haters are sad- make me reach for a tissue.
Poor people, got issues, they probably been misused-
Abused, bruised, bamboozled, no wonder they diss you.

They say that you dawdle, bein' a bad role model.
But that's not how you roll, and I still know that God'll
Forgive you, he sees thing your way cause he's swell.
(This might be because you are God, but oh well.)
 Oh, Oden he will always be the only God for me,
I don't believe Odin, only Oden with an E.
You're one cool crazy cat (note the alliteration,)
And you make my heart weep (that's personification!)

I hope, if it's possible, that my words have done
You justice, but if not I still hope they've begun
To educate people 'bout you and your skillage.
In the future, continue to pillage the village.
