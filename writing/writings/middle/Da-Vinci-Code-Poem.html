<h1>Da Vinci Code Poem</h1><img src="../../gifs/mona_lisa.gif">

It's late one night in the Louvre Museum
When the air is pierced by piercing scream.
The curator, named Jacques Sauniére,
Stares a strange man standing there:
He's a shrewd looking dude who is also kinda mean
With a bad attitude and an M-16.
Everything is good until he shot him spline.
Jacques is pretty screwed, and the dude fled the scene.

Jacques is on the ground, blood leaking from his pores,
So he looks around for something on the floor.
There is nothing to be found but an old apple core.
The situation is getting dire, when his eyes light up with fire...
He tries to be clever, and for no reason whatsoever,
His endeavor to confuzzle, he writes down a word puzzle.
The next day he was found, laying dead on the ground.
The police looked around, but all that they found
Was a note on the ground.  The mysterious note
Made no sense, and I quote:
"O, draconian devil!  Oh, lame saint!"
Unquote.
But you'll never guess, the police had no cleverness.
They knew that he wrote it, but they couldn't decode it.
So they hire a symbologist, his name is Robert Langdon,
And a professional cryptologist named Sophie Neveu.
The message was confusing so they kinda left it hangin',
They'd never seen something that random befo'.
They're about to take up golf and go on a vacation
When Robert Langdon has a revelation:
"O, draconian devil!" and "Oh, lame saint!"
The letters seem random, but really they ain't.
When they are rearranged, there's a big change.
He does it in a pinch, he has mad puzzle skillage,
And it spells out "Leonardo da Vinci" and "The Mona Lisa."
So he's feeling pretty good about his new discovery
When a policeman walked up to him and says rather gruffly,
"You're arrested for murdering Jacques Sauniére."
Robert Langdon replies, "Get out of here!
That's really lame, is this some kind of game?"
The policeman said, "No man, you just got framed."
So he is framed for a crime that he didn't commit
Instead of whoever really did it.
He feels he is at the end of wits,
To sum it all up: he's in some pretty deep shizz.
Well it sucks so bad he says "D'oh!"
When for some strange reason we shall never know,
Out of the shadows jumps Sophie Neveu!
They jump in a smart car and away they go.
So they drive all day, chased by the cops,
Solving puzzles on the way, oh the fun it never stops.
It's a puzzle trail, which was planted there
By the old and frail Jacques Sauniére.
But he wasn't alone, No, that we ain't buyin'...
He's in a group which is known as the "Priory of Sion."
They realize that these puzzles are more important than they thought,
And there will be dire consequences if and when they're caught.
The Priory of Sion has planted a trail
To lead them directly to the holy grail!
The grail contains a secret of biblical proportions
More controversial than gay marriage or abortions!
They need to know the entire story, and
So they go to the home of a holy grail historian.
Many essays he has written, he lives in Great Britain,
Leigh Teabing is his name, the holy grail is his game.
"The holy grail," he says, "is not a glowing golden cup.
That rumor is a mess.  Some guy just made it up."
He then tells them, no shizz, what the grail really is...
"There's a very old secret, from the day of Jesus.
Which if uncovered would spread like bad diseases.
It's been the church's secret for thousands of years,
But I've figured it all out.  All the evidence is here.
I've said it once, and I'll say it again:
Jesus had kids with Mary Magdalene!
So the grail, according to this theory of mine,
Is the woman who continued the Jesus bloodline.
In Leonardo's panting, which is called 'The Last Supper'
There should be the holy grail, Christ's symbolic golden cup.
Although there's none, there is someone who's sitting next to him:
And who is it?  You'll never guess:  It's Mary Magdalene."

They then go on adventures with their new, and British friend.
I'd tell you more but I don't really want to spoil the end.
