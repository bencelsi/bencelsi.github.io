<b class="letter">T</b> he king will rule until he dies, he deserves all his riches and fame,
<b class="letter">H</b> is right to rule was given by Christ, so we can kill to defend his name.
<b class="letter">E</b> veryone works like mules, so the king can eat a feast,

<b class="letter">C</b> hrist still approves of his right to rule, just as long as he's paying the priests.
<b class="letter">H</b> e could murder people all day long, slay civilians with his sword,
<b class="letter">U</b> ndoubtedly, he's done no wrong, for it's all in the name of the Lord.
<b class="letter">R</b> emember the church and all its done, it will never lead you astray,
<b class="letter">C</b> hrist's word is the only one, and the church will tell you what he means to say.
<b class="letter">H</b> oly days! The poem's almost over and I haven't used any vocabulary words! I hope I'm not excommunicated from class for this! Well, I'd like to thank Pope Gregory VII, Thomas Aquinas, and Henry IV for making this all possible. This poem was made at Winterhaven University, in Ms. Schumann's cathedral. I hope you've had a pilgrimage and a salvation of a good time!
