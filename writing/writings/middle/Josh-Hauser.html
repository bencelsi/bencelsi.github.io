When you tell my story tell ‘em my name is Josh Hauser
Tell ‘em PC computers make me want to squash mouse turds.
I take long hot showers, I floss for hours,
That’s right, I’m hygiene, I wear a pair of washed trousers!
I live with my cats who are a couple posh mousers,
That’s me in a nutshell, Josh Hauser, gosh wowzers!
You can call me Mighty J, by the way am I to say
That the thing I’m proudest ‘bout myself is... “IDK”
By the way, I am a German, and you may soon have determined
Than I’m even more annoying than a squirmin’ Pee-Wee Herman.

When you tell my story, tell ‘em I tell it like it is,
If you see Bill Gates tell him I’ll yell at him and kill his kids.
Don’t worry, I’ll be very tender-
-izingly blender-central in my method of killing him
And neutralizing his gender!  Ha ha!
I’d do it again and again and againder.
Take a gander, see I’m gorier than the knights of Gondor and/or a salamander.
Cause I was born and raised in Portland, Or.
Not as boring as Corbett, Or.
But more boring-er than Boring, Or.
Portland’s done, and I’m done exploring her!
So dull it’s boring holes in my skull,
So boring, my skull is full of bull!
Avoidable, devoid of lulls,
Now I’m finished: I render it void an’ null.
This hellhole still has some appeals:
Like Apple Computers, they’ve got some really great deals,
And ‘cause of that I’ve got a hot pair of iWheels.
I’m not idealist, But I am ideal,
And when I see an iMac, I admit it, I squeal.
And sure, I know I like to learn about plot points,
But I would much rather literally plot points.
That’s right, in math I got points.
I’m a hotshot, and my grades will not disappoint.
So when you tell my story, improvise or even ad lib it
Don’t (insert a random verb) my stroy, that’s a freakin’ mad lib, it
Makes me really mad that PC’s are really bad,
And if Steve Jobs was my dad, that would be totally rad.
Egads, I am a Methodist, my beliefs are the blessed-ist.
I guess it’s like a fountain or a plethora of gentleness.
I reminisced about the days when old John Wesley was
The famous-est religious founder, yes you better bet he was.
Even a messed up wretched meth-addicted pessimist
Once converted would learn all about the true meaning of specialness.
Speaking of specialness, John Adams was a Federalist
His wife’s a feminist although he could be slightly prejudiced.
I guess he’s still the very best-est of the special-est,
A specialist in specialness, he made it on my special list.
A gold medalist, he has robust abilities.
His life was worth more than sexual combustibility.
Kept his nobility even into his senility,
The probability of hostility was a high possibility.
Back to PC’s, they’re a species of feces,
They turn down the brightness like Reese’s pieces.
Me sees a Vista pushed out the window,
Guess that’s why they call it Windows XP.  Yeah, I been do’.
So when you tell my story tell ‘em my name is Josh Hauser
Tell ‘em PC computers make me want to squash mouse turds.
I take long hot showers, I floss for hours,
That’s right, I’m hygiene, I wear a pair of washed trousers!
I live with my cats who are a couple posh mousers,
That’s me in a nutshell, Josh Hauser, gosh wowzers!
