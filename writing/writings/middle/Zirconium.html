Zirconium, zirconium
I don't know what to say to you
You're an element with forty protons
You're also kind of shiny, too
You just sit there on the table
Stuck between two others just like you
Waiting dully, doing nothing
Sad and lonely, tinted blue
The periods, the rows and columns
Group you in with all the others
Nothing separates you from
Your equally conformist brothers
Slight differences, but none that matter
Just a silver shiny rock
Strange how little people care
About a universal building block.
