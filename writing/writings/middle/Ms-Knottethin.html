<h1>Ms. Knottethin</h1>

In a land faraway, in a school known as Watson,
There was an old teacher whose name was Ms. Knottethin.
Ms. Knottethin was drunk on tyrannical power,
She’d glower sourly down every day, every hour.
She banned lunch, ‘cause she said there were too many calories,
And then she complained ‘bout her very small salary.
We thought she was mean because of her dog Malorie
Who she accidentally shot in an old shooting gallery.


She gave us all homework, more than we could bare.
But then she didn’t grade it, she just didn’t care.
If you want to get in trouble, ask her ‘bout her hair.
We dare you.  There hardly is anything there.
She said she had cancer, but that was a lie.
Although that would be cool, because then she would die.
We knew she rubbed ointment into her bald scalp
Because every morning it smelled of sea kelp.
Ms. Knottethin’s a soul-sucking, child-eating leech
How did she acquire a license to teach?


One morning, Ms. Knottethin walked into the class,
All of us recoiled, disgusted, aghast.
Afraid that our next word may well be our last,
We shut up up our mouths, and we shut ‘em up fast.
Ms. Knottethin had quite a sour look on her face,
Like she just had been sprayed with cat urine and mace.
Then she said, her expression turning even scarier,
“Shut your fat pie-holes and sit on your derriere!
Alrighty.  Now listen up closely you fools,
I have to announce some of our new class rules.
For budget cut reasons, we’re quite low on dough.
And as a result, some things just must go.”
(We knew that she was lying about the new cuts,
But said nothing, for fear she would rip out our guts.
She probably kept all the cash for herself,
And spent it on hair products, like Kream of Kelp.)
“Pay attention!” she snapped, “And sit in your seat!
As I was just saying, some ends do not meet.
One example is that we’ve lost funding for recess.”
<i>What the heck?</i> we all thought, our hearts torn to pieces.


“The good news is that instead of having fun,
There are many more things that need to be done.”
<i>How could this be worse?</i> we thought, right as she said,
“We’ll be learning American history instead!
So although there’s no money for running or playing,
We still will have fun.  Now as I was saying,
We’re quite low on money, so I am applying
Some new sort of... taxes.  Now Jimmy, stop crying!
It’s really quite simple, I think you’ll agree.
Just, whenever you do certain things, you’ll pay me!
For instance, whenever you sharpen a pencil,
Or use the hole puncher, or borrow a stencil,
Raise your hand, use my paper or run in the halls
Use the bathroom, use duck tape or lean on the walls,
Depending upon the offense you commit,
You will owe either one or two dollars.  Got it?
Good!  I think that makes sense.  After all, it’s my stuff.”
<i>How stupid!</i> we thought. This has gone far enough.
Her logical basis is quite a disgrace.
The stuff is paid for by taxes in the first place!
It’s not hers to tax, and her case isn’t helped
By the fact that she’s keeping the cash for herself.
Then we heard her say something that should be a crime,
“Hey kids! It’s American history time!”


The movie we’ll see’s called 1776,
We’ll watch it five times to make sure that it sticks.
Your notes should be no less than ten pages long,
And if pages are missing, you’ll be marked as wrong.
I won’t actually read them, there’s too many pages,
But I mean who can blame me, considering my wages.
And I almost forgot, for the paper, you’ll pay
Me ten dollars each at the end of the day.”
The movie began while we sat in the classroom
And she shuffled off and locked herself in the bathroom.
We think that she smokes, behind that locked door,
As cigarette butts always litter the floor.
None of us knew just what else she did there,
Probably more sad attempts at regrowing her hair.


The history class was really a joke.
It was just an excuse for Ms. Knottethin to smoke.
While we sat their and suffered, and scribbled away,
She was having a carefree and average day.
Since Ms. Knottethin was teacher, nothing had been learned.
The boredom had gotten so painful it burned.
We’d put up with her now for just over two years,
And this new history class just affirmed all our fears.
These new changes she’d made were the very last straw.
No recess? More taxes? She’s breaking the law.
After school we assembled to discuss the matter.
“We must rebel!” rose a cry from the chatter.
“No!” rose another. “That would just be wrong!”
“So what do we care?” cried a boy who’s named Tom.
“We’ve had to put up with Ms. Knottethin too long.”
“Yeah!” came a reply from the large grumbling throng.
“We must take a stand. These taxes are wrong!
We will form a rebellion, together we’re strong!”


“I don’t like it!” said Tim. “This causes me fright!
Ms. Knottethin is teacher. She has to be right!”
“Even teachers have problems,” Tom said with a frown.
“And we’re one of hers, so now she’s going down!”
“But we’ll get in big trouble,” another exclaimed.
“When she’s through with us, we may well end up maimed.”
“What are you, British?” he said. “Go drink some tea!”
“But why must we be rash? We can ask her nicely!”
“You very well know that won’t work,” Tom then said.
“You can feel free to ask her. You will end up dead.
As for us, we’ll do something that really might work.
And if you don’t like it, then beat it, you jerk.
I have an idea that will make her pay,
And show her what we must go through every day...”


The very next morning, the class showed up early.
Ms. Knottethin sat at her desk looking pissed off and surly.
“What are you doing here?!?” she exclaimed when they entered.
She looked somewhat tired and slightly off-center.
“We just wanted to you show this thing in my palm,”
Said a visibly scared but determined young Tom.
He then smothered her face with a chloroform-cloth.
Ms. Knottethin went out like a light, the old sloth.


When Ms. Knottethin awoke, all the children were there,
Then she found she was gagged and duck-taped to a chair.
“MMF! MMF!” said Ms. Knottethin, and Tom said, “Okay,
Let’s see what our dear teacher has got to say.”
Tom then ripped the duck tape off of her hairy lips,
Which caused quite a loud, painful, and heart-wrenching RIP!
“YOU DUMB LITTLE RATS!” Ms. Knottethin then hollered.
“YOU’RE USING MY DUCK TAPE! YOU OWE ME TWO DOLLARS!”
“Okay shut her back up, let’s get on with our plot.
Ms. Knottethin, for you things ain’t looking so hot.”
“I do not approve of their actions,” said Tim.
But honestly nobody cared about him.
“We’ve been thinking it’s time you got what you deserved,
For being so mean. It just gets on our nerves.


And we have decided upon a solution:
There’s a marathon on the American Revolution.
It’s plays all day long on the History Channel,
Documentaries all about history’s annals.
With your head taped in place, you cannot look away.
Now, you’ll get to watch boring history shows the whole day!
And you’ll finally know what you made us go through,
When you make us do all of the things that we do.
While we could have been learning or playing or making,
We’ve been sitting in here, our backs bent and heads aching.
You’ve taken our lives, Ms. Knottethin, it’s true.
Years we’ll never get back, and it’s all ‘cause of you.
Six hours a day, times two hundred a year,
Times two years that you’ve wasted, Ms. Knottethin. Oh dear.
Oh, I almost forgot, times thirty of us.
If you’d taught us some math, I’d know how much that was.
But I still think I know, it’s a gosh-awful lot.
So if you think that we’re being unfair, well, we’re not.”


So the whole class then left to go play in the sun,
While Ms. Knottethin suffered, they all could have fun.
Even from outside they all heard cries and moans,
The screams were so loud that they rattled their bones
But all the commotion was still a-okay
Because all of the children felt happy and gay.
There would be no more days of sitting in class,
They could all say goodbye to being harassed.
When they came in they saw two white lumps on the floor.
“I don’t think Ms. Knottethin will see anymore.”
“Maybe we shouldn't have taped her eyes open so tight,
I think they dried up and that isn’t quite right.
Besides, I think she’s passed out from exhaustion.”
So they packaged her up and mailed her to Boston!
And that was the end of the old unfit gentry
That one fateful day at Watson, Elementary.


•••••••••••••••


The moral of the tale is, I think there’s no doubt:
If you don’t like your teacher, feel free to act out.
If whatever you say is ignored or is silenced,
When your words just don’t work, then you’ll have to use violence.
Remember that actions speak louder words,
And the world’s always full of more King George the Third’s.
