<h1>How to Write a How To Essay
<img src="../../gif/writing.gif"></h1>
    How do you start an expository essay? Often, you will want to start out by asking a question to involve your reader. The first paragraph is your introduction. It basically just gives the reader a generalization of what's going to happen over the course of the essay.
    Next, you have to write three or more detailed paragraphs about your topic. Each of these should have at least five sentences: Your introduction sentence, three or more detailed sentences, and a concluding sentence. If you want to make your essay more confusing but get better grades, you can also use idioms. But make sure they are well-integrated into your essay. Don't just add an idiom randomly into your essay or you will look like a stick in the mud. Don't go overboard with idioms: They are just meant to be the icing on the cake, not the pie in the sky. In fact, if you turn a blind eye to overdoing idioms, you'll wind up up a blind alley, and you just might kick the bucket.
    Also, if you would rather get good grades than a good essay, use words that start with the same letter to make them stand out. Now, consider this: Also use transition words.
    Next, you need to write the third paragraph. But sometimes your topic isn't broad enough to fill another paragraph. In this case, you might want to stall. Stalling can be done in many ways: Randomness, redundancy, and redundancy. They all work, but if you want good grades, just list off a bunch of idioms and transition words.
    Last but not least, now that you've learned about the first four paragraphs, you can learn about the last one- the conclusion. It's where you address different concepts that have appeared throughout the essay. It also includes the thesis... Hope you've learned a little more about the ancient and interesting art of the expository essay!
