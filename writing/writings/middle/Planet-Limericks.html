<img src="../../gifs/planets/mercury2.gif">
<b>Mercury</b><br>
There once was a planet called Mercury,
Which orbits the Sun rather jerkily.
But Mercury's hot
And aliens its got
So to go there we'll need good security.
<br>

<img src="../../gifs/planets/venus2.gif">
<b>Venus</b><br>
There once was a planet called Venus,
But nothing rhymes with Venus.
I just don't have time
To think of a rhyme,
Maybe a word like -----?
<br>

<img src="../../gifs/planets/earth3.gif">
<b>Earth</b><br>
There once was a planet called Earth,
Whoâ€™s screwed everything up since its birth.
We'll blow up our core
In a nuclear war
I guess that is all we are worth.
<br>

<img src="../../gifs/planets/mars.gif">
<b>Mars</b><br>
There once was a planet called Mars,
With a view of the stars. If our cars
Will screw up our air,
We can colonize there!
...An alternative planet to ours.
<br>

<img src="../../gifs/planets/jupiter.gif">
<b>Jupiter</b><br>
"There once was a planet called Jupiter,
Where boys go to get much more stupider."
This is yelled by small girls
All over the world
But whatever you do, don't you hit her.
<br>

<img src="../../gifs/planets/saturn.gif">
<b>Saturn</b><br>
There once was a planet called Saturn,
Which has a cool hexagon pattern.
If you went to its core,
I would question what for.
Because trust me, you wouldn't want that burn.
<br>

<img src="../../gifs/planets/uranus.gif">
<b>Uranus</b><br>
There once was a planet called Uranus,
Which is blue with a slight hint of grayness.
It's got rings, lots of mass,
And it's full of hot gas,
So Uranus is thought of as heinous.
<br>

<img src="../../gifs/planets/neptune.gif">
<b>Neptune</b><br>
There once was a planet called Neptune,
Which must orbit the sun, glow, and schlep moons.
Its storms have increased,
Making weather a beast.
So its climate may be out of step soon.
<br>

<img src="../../gifs/planets/pluto.gif">
<b>Pluto</b><br>
There once was a "planet" called Pluto,
Which wasn't a planet but just followed suit-O.
But then Pluto got the boot-O
By some scientist in a suit-O.
And now nobody really gives a hoot-O.
