  <h1>The Purple Ticket</h1>
    The air was gray and cold, and the clouds were dark and sagging, as if they were about to cry. I was trudging home from school, crushed by unfairness. I had just been suspended, for chopping off the class mouse's tail. Stupid mouse.
    Suddenly, I saw a flash of red out of the corner of my eye. I spun around and saw a fat, reddish, squirrell sitting in the middle of an empty parking lot. Since I found an unexplainable delight in scaring small animals, I decided I would try o chase it away. I crept carefully towards it, but the squirrel's eyes seemed to be glancing in every direction but mine. Finally, I stopped, only a few feet away. There was a tense silence as I contemplated what to do. I decided on a less creative approach. I reached down, picked up a rock, and, with all my strength, hurled it at the squirrel.
    There was a piercing shriek, of such surprising volume that I stumbled backwards. The shriek was similar to that of a cat, if you were to skin it and put it in a microwave (hypothetically speaking of course.) Finally, it ran out of breath, and, on its hind legs, made a beeline for the nearest exit. It seemed so terrified, though, that it didn't look where it was going, and in no time at all, ran smack dab into a tree. It wobbled around a git, then keeled over, dead!
    <i>I didn't mean to kill it,</i> I thought. Animals are less fun when they're dead. I jogged over to examine it.
    On its face was an expression of pure terror. Its mouth was crumpled into a frown, its eyes were even bigger than before. I glanced down, and saw something small and shiny clutched in its paws. Without hesitation I plucked it up. It was a little purple ticket, with bold letters printed neatly on both sides. I pocketed it and-
    There was a huge explosion, the force of which knocked me backwards, and knocked me out. When I awoke, there was a bright light shining in my face. As my vision cleared, I saw a silhouette... of a... giant ferret?
    I screamed and tried to look away, but the figure said, 
    "DO NOT TRY TO BREAK MY GAZE, FOR IF YOU DO, THEN YOU SHALL PAY."
    "That doesn't even rhyme," I said.
    "I'M SORRY YOU DON'T LIKE MY RHYMES. IT'S HARD TO THINK THEM UP IN TIME." The bad rhymes were too much for me. I curled up and started to cry. 
    "PLEASE DON'T CRY, I'M REALLY YOUR PAL. NOT LOOK IN YOUR POCKET. THERE'S SOMETHING PURPLE." 
    I reached in, and sure enough, there was the purple ticket. I picked it up and read the writing on the side:
    <i>ONE WAY TICKET TO HELL. NO REFUNDS.</i>
    "What the-"
    "YOU HAVE THE TICKET, THIS IS TRUE. THERE'S NO CASH BACK. YOU'RE PRETTY SCREWED."
    "First of all, true and screwed don't rhyme. Second of all, what the heck is going on? A giant talking ferret is telling me to go to hell for no apparent reason. Am I insane?!?"
    "THE REASON YOU'LL SUFFER ETERNAL PAIN- (OH, BY THE WAY YOU'RE NOT INSANE)
    AHEM. ITS BECAUSE OF YOUR CRUELTY, TOWARDS FELINES, CANINES, FISH AND POULTRY.
    YOUR TENDENCY TO TORTURE CRITTERS- IT'S WEIRD, AND IT GIVES ME THE JITTERS
    AND SO, THE DAY YOU KILLED THAT SQUIRREL, YOU GOT A ONE-WAY TICKET TO THE UNDERWORLD."
    "Shouldn't I be talking to God or something? Why are you a ferret?"
    "WHAT?!? YOU THINK A FERRET CAN'T BE GOD? YOU'RE A PATHETIC LITTLE SOD!
    THOSE WORDS MAY JUST HAVE BEEN YOUR LAST- THREE WORDS TO YOU, SIR: KISS MY WRATH!!!"
    Then, i felt the wrath of the ferret flow through me, more pain than I thought possible. I was being stoned to death, skinned alive, and burned to a crisp- I felt as if a tail I didn't have was being chopped off. Finally I broke down before my God, the almighty ferret.
    "Please", I sobbed, "forgive me for my sins. I will never be cruel to animals again. I've learned my lesson. I beg of you- please don't send me to hell." The ferret looked at me, for what seemed like an eternity, contemplating my fate. Finally, he whispered:
    "YOU'VE LEARNED THE LESSON OF THE TICKET. NOW, PLEASE DON'T BE A TOTAL DI-"
    Suddenly, I woke up in my bed. What?!? It was all a dream? Seriously?!?
    Relief crashed over me like a wave. I was warm and safe in bed, and it was a bright, sunny day. There were no ferrets in sight.
    I think I'll go drown some worms to celebrate!

    THE END
