<h1 style="text-align: center;">The 'Lewis Carroll Poem' Poem</h1>

One day in school we were assigned
To write our own descriptive poem.
I looked into my empty mind
I found a piece of foam.
The theme for this week's poem seems
Most definitely unfair.  I'll
Never in my wildest dreams
write quite like Lewis Carroll.
I think that nonsense writing
Is really quite a bore.  It
Just isn't that exciting.
So I think I'll just ignore it.
...And then Ms. Tran described a bit
Just how the poem should writ;
We had to be appropriate
Which meant no saying "$@!*#."
Ms. Tran told us to do something
Which I remember dimly...
What was it?  I'm not remembering...
Oh yeah... include a simile.
Similes use the word "Like,"
...Now I'll have to think of one.
But I can't seem to fit one in...  PSYCH!
This poem is, like, done.
