<h1>Life of Bob
<img src="../../gifs/caveman.gif"></h3>
</h1>
    Bob is a normal caveman. He lives alone in a cave. He spends most of the time looking for dead animals and eating dead animals.
    Of course, his name isn't really Bob. Cavemen don't have names. But you need a name to relate to a character- so, we will refer to him as Bob.
    
    Bob was born in spring to a small family. In fact, his family was family was fairly large, but most of his siblings had run away when their parents tried to eat them. The rest were eaten. Indeed, the same fate was to come to Bob- except Bob managed to get away. He didn't know why he wanted to get away, but something told him it wasn't a good idea to stick around.
    Bob ran until he got tired, which was fairly quickly. You could call him lost, but really he would be lost no matter where he was. He sat down and yawned. He wasn't sure how to interpret the things that happened to him. All he knew was that he was hungry. But not enough so that he would do anything about it.

    It had been almost an hour since he had laid down on the ground and fallen asleep. He got up and realized he was <i>very</i> hungry! He ran around in circles, hooting excitedly. He knew he would have to find some food soon. He picked up a leaf and shoved it in his mouth and chewed. It tasted funny. He tried to swallow it, but it wouldn't go down. Bob spat it out. He wasn't going to eat that again! He ran off looking for more food.
    While he was out walking, Bob saw some birds flying in the sky. He wanted to kill and eat them, but he couldn't. He was getting even hungrier.
    Forty-five minutes later, Bob was exhausted and nearly starving. He started to lick the ground... when he saw a dea squirrel. Bob shoved it in his mouth and chewed. It didn't all fit, but unlike the leaf, it went down. And, it tasted good! Great! Bob was overjoyed and started jumping. He felt full of energy. After jumping around, he got tired and laid down and fell asleep.

    As night came, Bob started shivering. It was getting cold. Bob tried to fall asleep again, but it was no use. As a desperate attempt to stay warm, he rolled over- but he only got colder! He howled and started shivering. He curled up in a tiny ball, which helped, but he was still freezing. Despite his exhaust, he got up and started looking for some kind of shelter.
    He found some tall grass, but it was het and cut his skin. He found a tree, but he couldn't climb it and monkeys started throwing things at him. He found a lake, but when he tried to get in it he got so cold he jumped around and shrieked and hooted. Then, he saw a cave...
    The cave was more of a low-down lip jutting out of the side of a mountain. It was full of bugs and other small creatures which Bob tried unsuccessfully to kill, and there was just enough room for Bob to lie down in. But it was slightly warmer than lying in a lake, so Bob  laid down and fell asleep there.

    The next morning, Bob was hungry again. He looked around for some food. This time he only found a dead rat. He ate it and not knowing what to do next ran back to his cave and fell asleep.

    The next day he found a dead monkey.

    The day after that, he found a dead bird. 

    Bob was moving into a routine. Every day, he would find dead animals and eat them. He was doing fairly well for a cavemen. The weather got warmer. Sometimes, he would go swimming in the lake when he had nothing else to do. He was happy with his life. In his mind, it was the most complex and satisfying life you could want.

    The fall moved in. It got colder. Bob discovered something new: berries. When he first tried a berry, he spit it out because he thought they tasted funny. Then he tried some more. He realized they were edible and ate half a bush of them. He didn't like them as much as meaad, but he ate them anyway. 
    The next day, he barfed up the berries. They weren't poisonous, but after eating meat all his life his stomach just wasn't used to them. Bob had grown to like them, though, so he continued eating berries until winter came. 

    He stopped eating berries because when winter came, Bob froze to death.
