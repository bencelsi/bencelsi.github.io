"Good grief!" said a Christian.
"God sure hasn't blessed us-
'Cause what could be worse
Than yersinia pestis?*"
"Dunno," said another.
"But I'll tell ya this, brother:
If he doesn't get happy,
Our lives will be crappy."
"You're right!" said the first.
"Our lives will get worse!
Let's whip ourselves 'til we go mad-
THEN god will know we're not so bad!"
"Good idea!" said the second.
"He might even stop the plague, I reckon!"
So lots of Christians (like Roman Catholics)
Beat themselves 'til they were phychopatholics.
They were the KKK of their day,
Killing Jews along the way.
So if you see people whippin' themselves in the pants,
Look out 'cause they might be 
THE FLAGELLANTS!
