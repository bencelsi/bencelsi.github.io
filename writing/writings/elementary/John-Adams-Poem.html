Oh, you've heard of Thomas Jefferson
George Washington as well.
But not of poor John Adams,
So his story I will tell:
He was born to hardworking family
Who wanted him to go to school.
But he didn't care what people said,
So he broke their studious rules.
As he slacked along, he realized
That education was propellin'
He decided he would go to school.
But no one had to tell 'im.
He went to Harvard College
And a lawyer he became.
His rebellious personality
Would lead him to his fame.
He pushed for independence,
Which left him quite forespent.
By 1797, though,
He was the president.
"Oh, go to war with France,"
Alex Hamilton implored him.
But Adams was a stubborn man,
So likewise, he ignored him.
Because he wouldn't go to war,
His term was of the dullest.
He became very unpopular
Among the Federalists.
Yet, despite these minor details,
He was honest, true, and wise.
People saw in him the bitter truth
Though he meant to tell them lies.
It wasn't that surprising
That he lost for re-election,
For his reign was catastrophic,
While Jefferson's was perfection.
He stomped out of the office,
His life a tangled mess,
He sat, his face screwed up in hate,
Quite thoroughly depressed.
