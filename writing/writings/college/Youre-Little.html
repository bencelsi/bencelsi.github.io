<h1>You're Little</h1><img src="../../gifs/baby.gif">
<div>
<!-- INTRO -->
You’re little, too little for pimples or stubble.
And yet you’re a rebel— your dimples spell trouble.
You garble and gurgle your verbal-ish burble,
You dribble your drool on a plush purple gerbil.
You’re partially mobile*: you waddle and booble, 
Full throttle, you toddle a wobbling waddle.
You’re forceful: you needfully snuggle in huddles,
Unrivaled, the megalo-mogul of cuddles.

You warble The Wiggles, not Buggles or Eagles,
You shuffle to pre-scuffle, post-skiffle Beatles.
You're puzzled by puzzles and other boondoggle:
You scrabble at Scrabble, you’re boggled by Boggle.

<!-- MOVIES, TV, BOOKS -->
You’re lingually baffled, befuddled, bamboozled.
To stumble through novels? A doubtful perusal.
"The Trial" on Kindle? Your vigilance dwindles.


Too youthful for Frindle or Anne of Green Gables,
You’re partial to oral recitals of fables:
Camelot, Hansel and Gretel, Kris Kringle,
Pan, Rumpelstiltskin, Rapunzel, Van Winkle.
We keep a few newfangled titles on shuffle, though:
Bemelmans’ Madeline, Donaldson’s Gruffalo.

Ms. Frizzle, Harold, the TMN Turtles,
Squirtle, The Jungle Book, Tootle or Yertle,
Tweedledee, Tweedledum, 


From Frizzle to Frindle, 
Heffalumps, Woozles...
Titular idols enkindle amusal.
(You write your own sequels, you squiggle and doodle ‘em.
Phrasally fuddled, they’re muddled sardoodledom.)


Your film predilections are metally gentle:
You’re totally ticked by Tangled, not Yentl.
Hiddleston, Ruffalo, Eccleston, Cheadle:
You marvel at Marvel with loyalty credal.

Don’t press fork to pencil! Not stencil, utensil!
I tousle my temple, my muscles grow tensile...
You whittle with chisels and scribble on easels,
You riddle the mantle with murals of weasels.


<!-- FOOD -->
You guttle up morsels in jubilant tumbles:
You crumple a creme brulee crumble (it crumbles.)
You shovel in Kettle chips, Pringles and Ruffles,
Your tipple is Red Bull, with guzzles unmuffled.
You tunefully croon for a spoonful of trifle,
You gargle a mouthful of treacle: an eyeful!
You chug apple Snapple, you chew Dubble Bubble,
You gobble up pretzels with knobbly nubbles.
You grovel for gumballs, you pick thicker strudels,
You smuggle some rum balls, you lick snickerdoodles!
You drizzle some treacly maple on waffles,
Then sample a most ample handful: How awful!
<!-- You twinkle:  An able appraisal, but it’ll
Not rival the level of hazelnut brittle. -->
<!-- Arugula, cantaloupe, cuttlefish, crumble. -->

You’re hostile to vittles that lack razzle-dazzle:
You shun pumpernickel, you’re frazzled by basil.
You'll suckle on curdling kettle corn kernels,
But broccoli bushels you label infernal?
From nostril to tonsil, your tastes are distasteful.
You wrinkle at jarfuls of mussels— how wasteful!
You’re stippled with freckles, yet fecklessly prickle
At prickles and speckles that dapple a pickle.
You’re fickle with fennel and startled by scrambles,
You grapple with ladles and gargle the Campbell’s.

You dabble in berries, both thimble and huckle,
You heckle falafel, you suck honeysuckle.
You'll nibble on noodles, but nasally crinkle
(the normal rebuttal to foods without sprinkles.)

You burgle a bagful of bugels or bagels,
Our battles get primal when foods are finagled.
<!-- Some simple examples:  -->

<!-- Yes skittles, no sorrel. No schnitzel or lentils, -->
Yes truffles (which type? Detrimental to dental.)


You wheedle: “White castle?” A dismal supposal;
I grumpily crumple that fragile proposal.







<!-- 
You riffle past Gumball and Smallville and Nashville,
Popples, The Mentalist, Angel and Castle,
Battlestar, Idol, The Middle, Hey Arnold,
Snagglepuss, Fraggle Rock, Seinfeld and Garfield,
Panels with Matalin, Carville, or Beckel,
Scandal, Miss Marple, and Heckle and Jeckle,
Frightful commercials with Ronald McDonald,
Kimmel and Cowell and Lawrence O’Donnell.
(You finally chuckle at Beanie and Cecil,
Once set on this channels, you’re docile and peaceful.) -->


<!-- “Dumbledore, Parseltongue, Hufflepuff, sickles!
Neville and Goyle and Dedalus Diggle!
Errol the owl and Quirrell and muggles!
Shacklebolt! Myrtle! Tom Riddle! Bowtruckles!”
I grumble— that film with the quaffles and thestrals?
You whistle its frivolous choral orchestrals. -->

<!-- MUSIC  -->
You brattle a rattle, you diddle a fiddle,
To tackle the bugle, you bubble your spittle.
With brash paradiddles you crackle a cymbal,
You tinkle triangles (plus thavils and timbals.)
You tootle a piccolo’s fipple, then dandle
And handily vandalize mandolin handles!
You tidily tickle out fugal-born jumbles,
You tonally bungle the flugelhorn’s rumbles.
A loud, instrumental ensemble assembles,
With turbulent trebles and tremulous trembles.
Don’t tweedle that thin metal kettle drum pedal!
Your sonic debacles enfeeble my fettle.

<!-- 
You fiddle with dreidels at your uncle Herschel’s,
They oscillate wildly, from ripples inertial.
At Battleship, marbles or farkle, you’re addled—
You paddle my iPad with paddleball paddles! --> -->

<!-- ANIMALS -->
You giggle and goggle at gaggles of seagulls.
You ogle, agog, at a scraggly beagle.
You sniggle for gunnels, and cheerfully coddle
The ruffles that spangle a small axolotl.
You wiggle the wattle of one woeful eagle,
A trifle which may be a trifle illegal.
In kennels, you meddle with kangal-bred poodles,
Then gobble their kibble, the whole kit-caboodle!
A snaggletooth cat, who is brindle and feral,
Has mangled my sandals and flannel apparel!
You nuzzle the muzzles of mongrels unstable,
You tinkle on hay bales in saddlebreds’ stables.
You dorsally straddle ambivalent cattle,
You buffalo buffalo, then you skidaddle.
You cripple the spindly tendrils of weevils,
beetles, and bumblebees- morally evil!
You cackle, and shackle some grackles to jackals,
Kerfuffles ensue as they bristle their hackles.
You jostle a petrel, a kestrel you throttle:
You’re gleefully channeling Quetzalcoatl!
Through brambles and thistles you ramble and straggle,
You gambol through nettles then amble, bedraggled.

••••••••••••••

You coastally snorkel through tidal pastorals:
Algal bloom, damselfish, nautili, corals,
Cockles, colossal squids, wobbegongs (tassled,)
Barreleyes, bristlemouths, winkles in passels,
Angelfish, devil fish, eagle rays, bluegills,
Muskellunge, barrel sponge, sticklebacks, mugils,
Shovelnose sturgeons, and bottlenose mammals—
You saddle a narwhal and ride like a camel!


<!-- q
A Playbill disciple, you can be ham a lot:
Frugal revivals of Hamilton, Spamalot.
You higgledy-piggledly staple my vinyl

Toodle-oo Garfunkel, Bangles, and Lionel. -->

You revel in regal arousal of rabble:
In chapel, you pummel the bible, then babble.
You topple the wimple atop Sister Ethel,
You needle the catholic beadle in bethel!
You soil your bowels, which spoils some towels,
I royally howl, recoil, and scowl.
In puddles of piddle, you rustle and scuttle…
Your bodily trickles aren't sterile or subtle.


<!-- With faculties nimble, and ease of Vin Diesel,
You breezily weasel from needles for measles. -->

<!-- You burgle my satchel, which falls on the griddle.
It sizzles and fizzles and burns in the middle!
You pedal the pedals of tri (not bi) cycles,
Then hurtle the marmalade towards uncle Michael! -->


<!-- THE TRIAL  -->
Your petulance fills me with oodles of scruples:
Not single, not double, not triple— quadruple.
You speedily shuttle from pitfall to peril.
Like Evel Knievel, through hurdles you barrel.
I twiddle a little invisible gavel,
A civil tribunal to shortly unravel…
You peddle your prattle (your own paralegal)
You’re shamefully blameful, an equal to Smeagol.
You tattle on Tottle (our turtle)— what twaddle!
You mumble and waffle and fumble and dawdle.
<!-- That scandalous rant’ll dismantle an ant hill!
You gabble untrammelled, no pommel or cantle. -->
You brabble your drivel and brash taradiddles.
I crackle my knuckles, you naggle: “ACQUITTAL!”

Your logic’s abysmal, it swivels in circles:
In essence, akin to that jingle of Urkel’s.
I signal your guilt by my eyeball parental,
The penalty’s awful— time out ‘til you're gentle.
You vocally call for my formal recusal—
My thoughts on this brutal accusal? Refusal.
Your jugular juggles a shrill, panicked yodel.
Your libelous scuttlebutt’s but anecdotal!
Your legal upheaval in shambles, you scramble—
And strangle the cat in a mad, screwball gamble.



You’re spoiled. Your privilege sparkles, unbridled.
A novel on you’d be entitled, “Entitled”.
I’ve trampled your hornswoggles, swindles and piffle,
You struggle to stifle your snuffles and sniffles.
<!-- You’re spinally brittle: you buckle and shrivel,
I’m venal, but I will not truckle to snivels! -->
No shekyls or rubles, no pigful of nickels
Can settle your debt in this sad, penal pickle.
You crankily tangle, I angrily wrangle,
You hang from your ankle and dangle at angles.
A snaggle of haggle, you waggle and wiggle,
You wriggle and joggle, you jangle and jiggle.
I cancel your squabbles— disgruntled, you trundle,
And nestle yourself in your trundle bed, bundled.
You’re partially tranquil, I thankfully idle.
I neurally toggle to neutral, and sidle.

<!-- OUTRO -->
The hustle and bustle of tussles paternal
Eternally spiral: diurnal, nocturnal.
At me all your quibbles and squabbles are funneled:
The mental equivalent of carpal tunnel.

Someday I will travel to Tripoli, Bassel
Brussels, Jerusalem, Balmoral castle,
Newcastle, Naples, Seattle, Grenoble
Bangalore, Appleton— even Chernobyl!
‘Til then, I will wrestle with postnatal riddles.
You're little, my angel, my angel, you're little.
