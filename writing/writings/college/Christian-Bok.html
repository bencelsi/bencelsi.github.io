	Christian Bök’s book is shit. To start it is a task, to scan it is a strain. Its narration is too cartoonish, its scansion is too brisk, it has crass connotations. Its so scant in its scansion that I can't scan it. It has no artistic basis to anchor it. In short, it stinks. 
	Is it ironic? Satiric, or sarcastic? No, its irritation is intrinsic. This book is a bionic horror, a robotic abstraction:  Bök's constant constraints constrict his chaotic consonants into crass contortions. Bök, that contrarian, insists on this. Bok is so into this constraint shit, I think it's a kink. Bök can't not soak his nib in his rank inkhorn: it's an sick itch to scratch, a narcotic habit as chronic as cannabis, tobacco, or crack. Not that it’s a knack- oh no. Bök's not an artist. Bök is no Titian, Cassatt, or Bosch. Shit, Bök's no Bob Ross. Bök's book is to art as an ant is to a rhino, as a rat's hiss is to a sonorant Bach cantata or Sinatra's croons- it's a stark contrast.
	As Bok soaks his nib in his sick inkhorn - ick!
	Bök is a hack, a batshit con artist, an anarchist kook, a schnook, a baboonish Torontonian hick. 
	
	Bök’s book is a scab on a cock, a rash on this nation's ass. a bacon stain on a koran (or torah).
	Bök is as skittish as an arthritic cockatoo, as brackish as a cockroach abortion, as hot as a ostrich (AKA, not). To ask Bök to concoct a book that’s not trash is to train a baboon to cook borscht.
	This book has no citations, it ranks on no charts, it's not canon. It isn't so-so; it is so, so, <i>so</i> so-so A kibosh on it! This is a non-book, an anti-book. I snort at it.
	Oh, Bök is a 'bioartist' too. Ha! Bioart is NOT art.

	Hint, hint: Bök’s book is on track to tank. Bök’s book, akin to Titanic or bitcoin, is soon to sink. I insist it is, so bank on it. Bök’s short stint in books is soon to hit a rock! Ciao, Christian! Bonsoir! Ta-ta! Thanks a ton (not!)

	Oh. Oh no. Oh no, no, no. NOOOOO!!! Bök’s book- it’s an instant hit?! I can’t. Bök’s book stocks bookracks in book chains across nations: China, Haiti, Costa Rica; Arabic nations (Iran, Bahrain)... on to Antarctica! Cancun to Cairo, Nairobi to Osaka: it's hot shit. This book has kickbacks, too: it's a boon to Bök's bankbook, a boost to his cash stash, a coin in his coin sack: in short, Bök has stacks on stacks. Hot to trot, Bök hobnobs boss book hochos, or chitchats hotshot critics or bookish brainiacs at “Christian Bök-a-Thons”. Ooh, it irks! Bök is in hot rotation as an orator at rich associations, NATO to NASA. Bök snacks on artisan croissants or raisin bonbons in chic bistros, as snobbish hosts toast Kirsch or chianti in his honor. Hoorah! Bök’s stock soars. That kiss-ass! Bök is a rockstar, an icon. Hot chicks in bikinis ask Bok to ink his Hancock across tan boobskin. Ick! Histrionic brats on TikTok stan Christian Bök's book as 'not basic'. Bök is so rich, ABC casts Bök as a co-host on 'Shark Tank' (this boots Barbara Corcoran). As an actor, Bök stars in Tarantino's horror-action-noir hit "Baccarat Broncos" as 'Casino Bob', across costar Oscar Isaac. This hoists Bök into an iconic strata: Britain anoints Bök (not British) “Sir Bök” in a historic coronation! Bök is an aristocrat actor? Oh, I abhor this- I abhor it so!

	I soak in an anarchic rancor. Bök, that traitor, has no honor. Bök's book is a tarnish on this Christian bastion. His book is an initiation in anarchist antics- it stirs racist associations in hicks, cranks, or kooks; it's an incitation to riot.  I shirk to think it: Soon, Bök-ian cohorts ransack train stations, accost hobos, harass asians, kick tots into trashcans. It isn't so, that as it is, I think it is soon. To cast this anachronistic caca in ink is an arrant sin! So, I chant: Toss this book in a bin! Roast it on a stick! Crank it into thin carbon bits! Knit it into a cotton boa! Stick it in a rabbit! Bark at it! Bonk a banana on it! (or a carrot.) Hiss at it, boo it! Cast it into Tarnation! Shoot at it: rat-a-tat-tat! Cart it into a hot cocoa bath (so as to stain it)! Boot it back to Toronto! Boot Bök (a Torontonian) back to Toronto too! Abstain! banish it!
<!-- Christ, Bök is a host on Shark Tank??? -->
	
	At Casa Bonita, I scoot into a booth. <i>Christ, I thirst to ban this book. Or, to bar or banish it.</i> I snack on ricotta-nacho tacos as I knock back a scotch shot. Soon, I concoct an acrostic:

<div style="width: 100px; margin: auto">
<b>C</b>hristian:
<b>H</b>is
<b>R</b>ot
<b>I</b>s
<b>S</b>oon
<b>T</b>o
<b>I</b>nhabit
<b>A</b>
<b>N</b>ation

<b>B</b>ank
<b>O</b>n
<b>K</b>abobs
</div>
	Bank on kabobs? Ok, this acrostic isn’t cast in iron. That as it is, I think Christian Bök is an anti-Christ, Satan's son, or both. I scan korans, torahs, archaic rabbinic books, sanskrit arcana:

	<i>Rhinos... bonobos... cockatoos... bison... cats?</i> Oh, that's Noah's ark.

	OK, this is it. A bit on satan:

	<i>Satan, AKA: Shaitan... Astaroth... Tchort... Bök... </i>

	...

	...BOK??????????
	
	Oh. Oh no. Oh no, no, no. Not this! It's as basic as ABC: Christian Bok is a satanic incarnation. Christian ain’t Christian, ironic.
	Oh, “Bank on kabobs”- I think ISIS is in cahoots, to boot! This is a crisis- an ISIS crisis! I knock back a ninth scotch shot.

	I can't sanction this, not a bit. So, I hatch an assassination tactic. In a cinch, I nab a Nissan hatchback. I sit carsick in transit as I shoot across Cincinnati, Saskatoon, San Antonio, Santa Ana, Boston, Ithaca (as an assassin, I can’t risk a short track, so I crisscross.) In Akron, Ohio I hit a raccoon and crash into a barn. Car can’t start, so I hitch to a train (choo, choo!), hook to a boat (toot, toot!), obtain a chariot (trot, trot!), ski on skis (ski, ski!), sit in a tractor (corn, corn!)... on to Toronto! <!--Chart a track -->
	
	In Toronto, I hit a tiki bar. I ask its inhabitants aboot Bök. I obtain corroboration that Bök is in his cabin. It's a bit north, so I catch a cab (honk, honk). "To Bök's cabin, sir!" I chant. "Thanks!"

	<div style="text-align: center;"><b>••••••••••••••</b></div>

	This is it. Christian Bok's cabin sits in an assassin's crosshairs. That assassin? It's I. 
	Knock? I think not.
	
	"IT IS I!" I crash into this cabin; bricks crack into bits. Christian Bök sits in a satin chair, in a cotton shirt, ascot, khaki shorts, a tan hat (so chic!).  In this action, I astonish Christian Bok.

	“THIS AIN’T KANSAS, TOTO!” I roar. Christian's skittish, so in an instant, I attack. I stab a shank into his back- his ribs crack as his torso is torn to torsions. Bök is a shish kabob! Or, a shish ka-Bök! I stick scissors into his incisors in an inartistic incision- it’s cathartic. His throat is intact, so I thrash at it. I stick a tack an inch into his iris. I bash in his brains, so as to bask in his brain bits. Christian Bök croaks.
	<!--  -->
	<i>Tick, tock, tick, tock…</i>

	I sit in shock. Christian is catatonic: abrasions anoint his skin, soon to scar. Thick stains taint his shirt (it ain’t Sriracha or Tabasco.) His aorta is torn to ribbons- no bacitracin, niacin or antibiotics can assist a boo-boo as harsh as that. Is this a trick? A crisis actor? I think not. Horror sinks in. I catch a sob. “Oh, Christian- I cannot contain it!” Inhibitions shrink. Attraction throbs. I kiss Christian- his hair, his socks, his crotch. It’s so taboo, I can’t not. Soon, I start to a thirst. I thirst to inhabit Christian Bök, to soak in Christian Bök... to <i>absorb</i> Christian Bök. So, I toss his brain bits into a non-stick crock. As it starts to scorch, I stir in onion stock, cornstarch, tahini, harissa... it cooks into a brackish broth, akin to a risotto. As-is, it's OK on toast. TBH, I ain't a cook.
	<!-- his cock, his taint -->

	OK. This is too chaotic.
	
	Christian Bök isn’t hot, it’s a sin to think so. Nosh on his brains? Ick, no thanks. Bök is a carcass, that's that. I can’t backtrack, nor can I risk inaction- Toronto’s not an oasis, it shan’t harbor a crook. So, on an arsonistic kick, I torch his cabin. As it chars, I sit criss-cross, in a rain-torn shack. Hot ash soars into orbit; it coats a birch branch. Bök’s cabin contorts into soot. Christian Bök is toast. I sob.

<div style="text-align: center;"><b>••••••••••••••</b></div>
	A notion took root, I think, at that cabin. A transition. As I think back on that occasion, I ask: is assassination OK?
	No. It is not OK. Assassination is a boorish, narcissistic act- not an act to boast on. I ain’t a saint; I sank to act on a barbaric instinct. I took a torch to a tacit oath, I shat on a sacrosanct contract. No brain acrobatics can sooth this contrition, not an iota. So. No sass, snark, or schtick: assassination is a no-no, OK? Arson too. That's it. Thanks.
