	<!-- (Besides this sentence, this is review includes only the letters in "Christian Bok") -->


	Christian Bök's book is shit. It's too brisk, its narration is catatonic, it contains crass connotations in its brackish bars. To start it is a task: its scansion is so scant that it's a strain to scan it. This book has no artistic basis to anchor it; in short, it stinks.
	Is it ironic? Satiric, or sarcastic? No, its irritation is intrinsic. This book is a bionic horror, a robotic abstraction: constant constraints constrict its cartoonish consonants into inconsonant contortions. Bök, that contrarian, insists on this- Bok is so into constraints, I think it's a sick kink. A kibosh on it! This book has no citations, it ranks on no charts, it's not canon. It isn't so-so; it is so, so, <i>so</i> so-so. This is a non-book, an anti-book. I snort at it.
	That as it is, Bök can't not scratch his Rorchachian ink: it's an inborn kink, a sick itch to scratch, a cocainist's scab. To soak his nib in that rank inkhorn is a narcotic habit as chronic as cannabis, tobacco, or crack. Not that it's a knack- oh no. Bök's not an artist. Bök is no Titian, Cassatt, Corot or Bosch. Shit, Bök's no Bob Ross. Bok's book is to art as an arthritic cockroach is to a rhino; as a rat's hiss is to Sinatra's croon; as Christian rock is to a Bach cantata: It's a stark contrast. Bök is a hack, a con artist, a schnook. To train Bök to concoct a book that's not trash is to train a baboon to cook borscht. Oh, Bök is a 'bioartist' too. Ha! Bioart is NOT art.
	
	<!-- Bök's book is a scab on a cock, a rash on a baboon's ass, a bacon stain on a koran. -->
	<!-- Con artist - his book his con art. To train Bök to concoct a book that's not trash is to train a baboon to cook borscht. --
	<!-- Bök is as skittish as an arthritic cockroach, this book is a cockroach abortion, as hot as a bronchitic ostrich (AKA, not).  -->
	
	So, I chant an incantation: Toss this book in a bin! Roast it on a stick! Hiss or boo at it! Crank it into thin carbon bits! Knit it into a cotton boa! Stick it in a rabbit's ass! Bark at it! Bonk a banana on it! (or a carrot.) Cast it into Tarnation! Shoot at it: rat-a-tat-tat! Cart it into a hot cocoa bath (so as to stain it!) Boot it back to Toronto! Boot Bök (a Torontonian) back to Toronto too!

Bok's stint in books s
-->
	Hint, hint: Bök's short stint in books is on track to hit a rock, soon to sink; think Titanic or bitcoin. I insist it is, so bank on it. Ciao, Christian! Bonsoir! Ta-ta! Thanks a ton (not!)

	Oh. Oh no. Oh no, no, no. NOOOOO!!! Bök's book- it's an instant hit?! It can't- it is. Bök's book stocks bookracks in book chains across nations: China, Haiti, Bosnia, Croatia, Costa Rica. Arabic nations too: Iran, Bahrain... on to Antarctica! Cancun to Cairo, Nairobi to Osaka, Boston to Bora Bora: it's hot shit. This book has kickbacks, too: it's a boon to Bök's bankbook, a boost to his cash stash, a coin in his coin sack: in short, Bök has stacks on stacks. Hot to trot, Bök hobnobs: Bok chitchats to boss hochos, boasts to hotshot critics or bookish brainiacs at "Christian Bök-a-Thons". Ooh, it irks! Bök, in hot rotation as an orator, snacks on artisan croissants or raisin bonbons in chic bistros, as snobbish hosts toast chianti in his honor. Hoorah! Bök's stock soars. That kiss-ass! Bok's orations attract 'Bok-ian' cohorts: brash book bros hoot, chicks coo or toss bras, snatch at his crotch. Bök is a rockstar, an icon. Brats on TikTok stan Bök's book as 'not basic'. Hot chicks in bikinis ask Bok to ink his Hancock across tan boobskin. Ick! Soon, 'Bok Inc.' concocts Bok knickknacks: Bok hats, Bok socks; this shit is kitsch bric-a-brac. Bök is so rich, ABC casts Bök as a co-host on 'Shark Tank' (this boots Barbara Corcoran). Bok stars as 'Baccarat Bob' in Tarantino's horror-action-noir hit "Casino Broncos"; Bok nabs an Oscar. (this irks his costar, Oscar Isaac.) At a historic coronation, Britain anoints Bök (not British) "Sir Bök". This hoists Bök to an iconic strata, akin to Saint Nick or Christ. Bök is a rich aristocratic rockstar actor? Oh, I abhor this- I abhor it so!
<!-- Aniston, Chris Rock / RIch in honoraria-->
	I soak in hot rancor. Bök, that traitor, has no tact. To cast his anachronistic caca in ink is an arrant sin. Sans Bok, this nation is a Christian bastion. As is, it's on track to tank. Bok's book is an incitation to riot- 
	As batshit kooks scan that Rorshachian ink,
	it stirs racist associations in baboonish hicks, it knocks batshit cranks in tin hats to act on anarchic antics. I shirk to think it: Soon, 'Bök-ian' kooks ransack train stations, accost hobos in rain-torn shacks, toss bricks at arabs, harass asians chicks, torch Shintoist toriis, kick skittish cats into trashcans, or chant 'nanana booboo' at a sick tot in a cast. It isn't so in this instant, that as it is, this nation sits on brink: thanks to Bok's book, anarchist shit can soon start (I think). Hook or crook, I can't sit back as Bok's book this nation sinks into coast to coast chaos. Shit no! 
	
	I scoot into a booth at Casa Bonita. <i>Hook or crook, I thirst to ban this book,<i> I think. </i>Or, bar or banish it.</i> I snack on ricotta-nacho tacos as I knock back a scotch shot. Soon, I concoct an acrostic:

<div style="width: 100px; margin: auto">
<b>C</b>hristian:
<b>H</b>is
<b>R</b>ot
<b>I</b>s
<b>S</b>oon
<b>T</b>o
<b>I</b>nhabit
<b>A</b>
<b>N</b>ation

<b>B</b>ank
<b>O</b>n
<b>K</b>abobs
</div>
	Bank on Kabobs? Ok, this acrostic isn't cast in iron. That as it is, I think Christian Bök is an anti-Christ, Satan's son, or both. I scan archaic rabbinic books, sanskrit arcana:

	<i>Rhinos... bonobos... cockatoos... bison... cats?</i> Oh, that's Noah's ark.

	OK, this is it. A bit on satan:

	<i>Satan, AKA: Shaitan... Astaroth... Tchort... Bök... </i>

	...

	...BOK??????????
	
	Oh. Oh no. Oh no, no, no. Not this!!! It's basic as ABC: Christian Bok is a satanic incarnation. Christian ain't Christian, ironic.
	Oh, "Bank on kabobs"- I think ISIS is in cahoots, to boot! This is a crisis- an ISIS crisis! I knock back a ninth shot.

	I can't sanction this, not a bit. So, I hatch an assassination tactic. In a cinch, I obtain a Nissan hatchback. I crank ABBA's hit 'SOS'; I soak in its sonorant hooks. I sit carsick in transit as I shoot across Cincinnati, Saskatoon, San Antonio, Santa Ana, Boston, Ithaca (as an assassin, I can't risk a short track, so I crisscross.) In Akron, Ohio I hit a raccoon and crash into a barn. Car can't start, so I hitch to a train (choo, choo!), hook to a boat (toot, toot!), sit in a chariot (trot, trot!), ski on skis (ski, ski!), nab a tractor (corn, corn!)... on to Toronto! 
	In Toronto, at a tiki bar, I ask Toronto's inhabitants aboot Bök. I obtain corroboration that Bök is in his cabin. It's a bit north, so I catch a cab (honk, honk). "To Bök's cabin, sir! Thanks!"
<!--Chart a track -->
	<div style="text-align: center;"><b>••••••••••••••</b></div>

	This is it. Christian Bok's cabin sits in an assassin's crosshairs. That assassin? It's I. 
	Knock? I think not.
	
	"IT IS I!" I crash into his cabin; bricks crack into bits. Christian Bök sits in a satin chair, in a cotton shirt, ascot, khaki shorts (so chic!).

	"THIS AIN'T KANSAS, TOTO!" I roar. In an instant, I attack. I stab a shank into his back- his ribs crack as his torso is torn to torsions. Bök is a shish kabob! Or, a shish ka-Bök! I stick scissors into his incisors in an inartistic incision. His throat is intact, so I thrash at it. I stick a tack an inch into his iris. I skin his thin shins. I bash in his brains, I bask in his brain bits. Christian Bök croaks (this ain't a ribbit.)
	<!--  -->
	<i>Tick, tock, tick, tock…</i>

	I sit in shock. Abrasions that shan't scar. Thick stains taint his shirt a sick tint (this ain't Sriracha or Tabasco.) His aorta is torn to ribbons- no bacitracin, niacin or antibiotics can assist a boo-boo as harsh as that. Is this a trick? I think not. Horror sinks in. I catch a sob. "Oh, Christian- I cannot contain it!" Inhibitions shrink. Attraction throbs. I kiss Christian- his hair to his socks.  I scan his crotch. It's so taboo, I can't not. I broach his shorts. I kiss his cock, soon I start to throat it. So hot! As sick as this is, I can’t attain satiation. Soon, a sick kink kicks in- I thirst to inhabit Christian Bök, to soak in Christian Bok... to <i>absorb</i> Christian Bök. So, castration, I hack into his cock. I cook it in crisco in a nonstick crock. I toss in his brain bits, too. As this chars, so I stir in onion stock, cornstarch, tahini, ranch... it cooks into a thick broth (think: risotto that has a cock in it). It's OK on toast, sorta. This is tantric, carthartic.
	<!-- It's OK on toast, sorta. I aint a cook, TBH-->

	I kiss Christian bok. his hair, his socks. I scan his crotch, 
	No, I can.  I kiss on his cock, soon I start to throat it.
	I stick his thick cock in this book critic’s ass. It’s so taboo, I can’t not. So hot!  I thirst to inhabit Christian Bok, to absorb Christian Bok. 
	It has a cost
	
	Aristocrats!
	
	Hook or crook
	<!-- his cock, his taint 
	 -->

	OK. This is TOO chaotic.
	
	Christian Bök isn't hot, it's a sin to think so. Nosh on his brains? Ick, no thanks. Bök is a carcass, that's that. I can't backtrack, nor can I risk inaction- Toronto's not an oasis, it shan't harbor a crook. So, on an arsonistic kick, I torch his cabin. As it roasts, I sit across a short tract, criss-cross in Bok's cabana. Hot ash soars into orbit; it coats a birch branch. Bök's cabin contorts into soot. Christian Bök is toast. I sob. (boo, hoo)

<div style="text-align: center;"><b>••••••••••••••</b></div>
	A notion took root, I think, at that cabin. A transition. As I think back on that occasion, I ask: is assassination OK?
	No. It's not OK. Assassination is a boorish, narcissistic act- not an act to boast on. I ain't a saint; I sank to act on a barbaric instinct. I took a torch to a tacit oath, I shat on a sacrosanct contract. No brain acrobatics can sooth this contrition, not an iota. So. No sass, snark, or schtick: assassination is a no-no, OK? Arson too. That's it. Thanks.
