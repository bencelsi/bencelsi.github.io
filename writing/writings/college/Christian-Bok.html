	Christian Bök's book is shit. It's a task to start it. It's too brisk, its narration is catatonic, it contains crass connotations in its brackish bars. Its scansion is so scant, it's a strain to scan. It has no artistic basis to anchor it; in short, it stinks.
	Is it ironic? Satiric, or sarcastic? No, its irritation is intrinsic. This book is a bionic horror, a robotic abstraction: Bök's constant constraints constrict his chaotic consonants into cartoonish contortions. Bök, that contrarian, insists on this. Bok is so into his constraints, I think it's a sick kink. A kibosh on it! This book has no citations, it ranks on no charts, it's not canon. It isn't so-so; it is so, so, <i>so</i> so-so. This is a non-book, an anti-book. I snort at it.
	That as it is, Bök can't not scratch his ink nib: it's an inborn kink, a sick itch to scratch. To soak his nib in that rank inkhorn is narcotic habit as chronic as cannabis, tobacco, or crack. Not that it's a knack- oh no. Bök's not an artist. Bök is no Titian, Cassatt, Corot or Bosch. Shit, Bök's no Bob Ross. Bok's book is to art as a rat is to a rhino, as a cartoon is to a cantata, as a cockroach's hiss is to a Bach cantata or Sinatra's croons: It's a stark contrast. 
	As a Bach cantata is to Christian rock is to a Bach cantata:


	To train Bök to concoct a book that's not trash is to train a baboon to cook borscht.
	
	Bök's book is a scab on a cock, a rash on this nation's ass, a bacon stain on a koran.
	Con artist - his book his con art. To train Bök to concoct a book that's not trash is to train a baboon to cook borscht.
	
	
	(Oh, Bök is a 'bioartist' too. Ha! Bioart is NOT art.)

	Bök is a hack, a batshit con artist, a schnook.
	that has a con
	
	Bök is as skittish as an arthritic cockroach, this book is a cockroach abortion, as hot as a bronchitic ostrich (AKA, not). 
	
	So, I chant an incantation: Toss this book in a bin! Roast it on a stick! Hiss or boo at it! Crank it into thin carbon bits! Knit it into a cotton boa! Stick it in a rabbit's ass! Bark at it! Bonk a banana on it! (or a carrot.) Cast it into Tarnation! Shoot at it: rat-a-tat-tat! Cart it into a hot cocoa bath (so as to stain it!) Boot it back to Toronto! Boot Bök (a Torontonian) back to Toronto too!

	Hint, hint: Bok's book is soon to sink- think bitcoin or Titanic. I insist it is, as a critic, so bank on it. Bök's short stint in books is soon to hit a rock. Ciao, Christian! Bonsoir! Ta-ta! Thanks a ton (not!)

	Oh. Oh no. Oh no, no, no. NOOOOO!!! Bök's book- it's an instant hit?! I can't. Bök's book stocks bookracks in book chains across nations: China, Haiti, Bosnia, Croatia, Costa Rica; Arabic nations too, Iran, Bahrain... on to Antarctica! Cancun to Cairo, Nairobi to Osaka: it's hot shit. This book has kickbacks, too: it's a boon to Bök's bankbook, a boost to his cash stash, a coin in his coin sack: in short, Bök has stacks on stacks. Hot to trot, Bök hobnobs boss hochos, or chitchats to hotshot critics. Ooh, it irks! Bök, in hot rotation as an orator, snacks on artisan croissants or raisin bonbons in chic bistros, as snobbish hosts toast Kirsch or chianti in his honor. Hoorah! Bök's stock soars. That kiss-ass! Bök is a rockstar, an icon. at "Christian Bök-a-Thons", hot chicks in bikinis ask Bok to ink his Hancock across tan boobskin. Ick! Bookish brainiacs think his book is book is 'Rorschachian incantation'. Histrionic brats on TikTok stan Bök's book as 'not basic, tbh'. Bök is so rich, ABC casts Bök as a co-host on 'Shark Tank' (this boots Barbara Corcoran). Tarantino casts Bök as costar to Oscar Isaac in his horror-action-noir hit "Casino Broncos". This hoists Bök to an iconic strata akin to Saint Nick or Christ. Britain anoints Bök (not British) "Sir Bök" at a historic coronation! Bök is a rich aristocratic rockstar actor? Oh, I abhor this- I abhor it so!
<!-- Aniston, Chris Rock -->
	I soak in a hot rancor. Bök, that traitor, has no tact. To cast his anachronistic caca in ink is an arrant sin. Sans-Bok, this nation is a Christian bastion. As is, it's on track to Satan. Bok's book is an initiator in anarchist antics- it stirs racist associations in baboonish hicks or batshit cranks in tin hats; it's an incitation to riot. I shirk to think it: Soon, Bök-ian cohorts can ransack a train station, torch a cabana, Shintoist toriis, accost hobos, toss bricks at arabs, harass asians chicks, or kick a skittish tot into a trashcan! Chant 'nanana booboo' at a chick in a cast, this tot sobs (boo-hoo) It isn't so in this instant, that as it is, I think its on track. can I sit back as Bok's book sinks this nation into coast to coast chaos? Shit No!
	
	I scoot into a booth at a Casa Bonita. <i>Christ, I thirst to ban this book,<i> I think. </i>Or, bar or banish it.</i> I snack on ricotta-nacho tacos as I knock back a scotch shot. Soon, I concoct an acrostic:

<div style="width: 100px; margin: auto">
<b>C</b>hristian:
<b>H</b>is
<b>R</b>ot
<b>I</b>s
<b>S</b>oon
<b>T</b>o
<b>I</b>nhabit
<b>A</b>
<b>N</b>ation

<b>B</b>ank
<b>O</b>n
<b>K</b>abobs
</div>
	Bank on Kabobs? Ok, this acrostic isn't cast in iron. That as it is, I think Christian Bök is an anti-Christ, Satan's son, or both. I scan archaic rabbinic books, sanskrit arcana:

	<i>Rhinos... bonobos... cockatoos... bison... cats?</i> Oh, that's Noah's ark.

	OK, this is it. A bit on satan:

	<i>Satan, AKA: Shaitan... Astaroth... Tchort... Bök... </i>

	...

	...BOK??????????
	
	Oh. Oh no. Oh no, no, no. Not this!!! It's as basic as ABC: Christian Bok is a satanic incarnation. Christian ain't Christian, ironic.
	Oh, "Bank on kabobs"- I think ISIS is in cahoots, to boot! This is a crisis- an ISIS crisis! I knock back a ninth shot.

	I can't sanction this, not a bit. So, I hatch an assassination tactic. In a cinch, I obtain a Nissan hatchback. I crank ABBA's hit, 'SOS'. I soak in its sonorant hooks as I sit carsick in transit. I shoot across Cincinnati, Saskatoon, San Antonio, Santa Ana, Boston, Ithaca (as an assassin, I can't risk a short track, so I crisscross.) In Akron, Ohio I hit a raccoon and crash into a barn. Car can't start, so I hitch to a train (choo, choo!), hook to a boat (toot, toot!), nab a chariot (trot, trot!), ski on skis (ski, ski!), sit in a tractor (corn, corn!)... on to Toronto! 
	In a tiki bar, I ask Toronto's inhabitants aboot Bök. I obtain corroboration that Bök is in his cabin. It's a bit north, so I catch a cab (honk, honk). "To Bök's cabin, sir! Thanks!"
<!--Chart a track -->
	<div style="text-align: center;"><b>••••••••••••••</b></div>

	This is it. Christian Bok's cabin sits in an assassin's crosshairs. That assassin? It's I. 
	Knock? I think not.
	
	"IT IS I!" I crash into his cabin; bricks crack into bits. Christian Bök sits in a satin chair, in a cotton shirt, ascot, khaki shorts, a tan hat (so chic!). I astonish Christian Bok.

	"THIS AIN'T KANSAS, TOTO!" I roar. Christian's skittish, so in an instant, I attack. I stab a shank into his back- his ribs crack as his torso is torn to torsions. Bök is a shish kabob! Or, a shish ka-Bök! I stick scissors into his incisors in an inartistic incision- it's cathartic. His throat is intact, so I thrash at it. I stick a tack an inch into his iris. I skin his thin shins. I bash in his brains, so as to bask in his brain bits. Christian Bök croaks (this ain't a ribbit.)
	<!--  -->
	<i>Tick, tock, tick, tock…</i>

	I sit in shock. Abrasions tarnish Christian's skin, soon to scar. Thick stains taint his shirt (it ain't Sriracha or Tabasco.) His aorta is torn to ribbons- no bacitracin, niacin or antibiotics can assist a boo-boo as harsh as that. Is this a trick? I think not. Horror sinks in. I catch a sob. "Oh, Christian- I cannot contain it!" Inhibitions shrink. Attraction throbs. I kiss Christian- his hair, his socks, his crotch. It's so taboo, I can't not. Soon, a sick kink starts to - I thirst to inhabit Christian Bök... to <i>absorb</i> Christian Bök. So, I cook his brain bits into a nonstick crock. It starts to char, so I stir in onion stock, cornstarch, tahini, ranch... it cooks into a thick broth. Think risotto. It's OK, sorta. 
	<!-- It's OK on toast, sorta. -->
	<!-- his cock, his taint harissa-->

	OK. This is TOO chaotic.
	
	Christian Bök isn't hot, it's a sin to think so. Nosh on his brains? Ick, no thanks. Bök is a carcass, that's that. I can't backtrack, nor can I risk inaction- Toronto's not an oasis, it shan't harbor a crook. So, on an arsonistic kick, I torch his cabin. As it roasts, I sit criss-cross in a rain-torn shack. Hot ash soars into orbit; it coats a birch branch. Bök's cabin contorts into soot. Christian Bök is toast. I sob. (boo, hoo)

<div style="text-align: center;"><b>••••••••••••••</b></div>
	A notion took root, I think, at that cabin. A transition. As I think back on that occasion, I ask: is assassination OK?
	No. It's not OK. Assassination is a boorish, narcissistic act- not an act to boast on. I ain't a saint; I sank to act on a barbaric instinct. I took a torch to a tacit oath, I shat on a sacrosanct contract. No brain acrobatics can sooth this contrition, not an iota. So. No sass, snark, or schtick: assassination is a no-no, OK? Arson too. That's it. Thanks.
