	Christian Bök’s book is shit. To start it is a task, to scan it is a strain. Its narration is too thin, its scansions too scant, its consonants too... inconsonant. In short, it stinks.
	It's as thin as hot air, as basic as ABC. 
	
	Is it ironic, satiric, or sarcastic? No, its irritation is intrinsic. This book is a bionic horror, a robotic abstraction: Bök's constant constraints constrict his chaotic consonants into crass contortions that contain crass connotations. Bök, that contrarian, insists on this. This book has no citations, it ranks on no charts, it's not canon. It isn't so-so; it is so, so, <i>so</i> so-so A kibosh on it! This is a non-book, an anti-book. I snort at it.
<!-- crass contrarian -->
	That as it is, Bök can't not scratch his ink nib- it's an inborn kink, a sick itch to scratch, a narcotic habit as chronic as crack, tobacco or cannabis. Not that it’s a knack- oh no. Bök isn't an artist. Bök's no Titian, Cassatt, Corot, or Bosch. Shit, Bök's no Bob Ross. Bök's book is to art as a cat's hiss is to a sonorant Bach cantata or Sinatra's croons- it's a stark contrast.
	<!-- or soak it in inkhorn -->
	This book 
	Bök is a hack, a batshit con artist, an anarchist kook, a contratian schnook, a baboonish, a Torontonian hick. 
	
	a tsi-tsi, and arrant irration.
	Bök’s book is a scab on a cock, a crab on a hot chick’s boob, a bacon stain on a koran (or torah).
	Bök is as skittish as an arthritic cockatoo, as brackish as a cockroach abortion, as hot as a ostrich in a bikini (AKA, not). To train Bök to concoct a book that’s not trash is to train a baboon to cook borscht.

	Oh, Bök is a 'bioartist' too. Ha! Bioart IS NOT art.
	Oh, Christian Bok isn't hot, too.
	  Tsk, tsk.
<!-- as ant is to a rhino thick cock- 
	To birth it is a sin

<!-- Bök's no Bacharach, no OConnor. Tin-tin

A hick, a kook,  a bitch, batshit boorish
is that so?

	Hint, hint: Bök’s book is on track to tank. I insist it is, so bank on it. Bök’s book, akin to Titanic or bitcoin, is soon to sink. Bök’s short stint in books hits a rock! Ciao, Christian! Bonsoir! Ta-ta! Thanks a ton (not!)

	Oh. Oh no. Oh no, no, no. NOOOOO!!! Bök’s book- it’s a hit?! It can’t- it is. Bök’s book stocks book racks in book chains across nations: China, Haiti, Costa Rica... Arabic nations (Iran, Bahrain)... on to Antarctica! Cancun to Cairo; Nairobi to Osaka: it's hot shit. Hot to trot, Bök hobnobs hotshot critics, or chitchats to bookish brainiacs at “Christian Bök-a-Thons”. Ooh, it irks! Bök is in rotation as an orator at rich associations. Bök snacks on artisan croissants or raisin bonbons in chic bistros, as snobbish hosts toast Scotch, Kirsch or chianti in his honor. Hoorah! Bök’s stock soars. That kiss-ass! Bök is a rockstar, an icon. Hot chicks in bikinis  Histrionic brats on TikTok stan Christian Bök's book as 'not basic'. This book has kickbacks, too: it's a boon to Bök's bankbook, a boost to his cash stash, a coin in his coin sack: in short, Bök has stacks on stacks. Bök is so rich, ABC casts Bök as a co-host on 'Shark Tank' (this boots Barbara Corcoran). Tarantino casts Bök as costar to Chris Rock in a hit horror/action/noir. This hoists Bök into an iconic strata: Britain anoints Bök (not British) “Sir Bök” in a historic coronation! Bök as an aristocrat? Oh, I abhor this- I abhor it so!
<!-- Aniston, Chris Rock -->
	I soak in an anarchic rancor. Bök, that traitor, has no honor. Bök's book is a rash on this nation’s ass, a tarnish on this Christian bastion. His book is an initiation in anarchist antics- it stirs racist associations in hicks, cranks, or kooks; it's an incitation to riot.  Bök-ian cohorts ransack train stations, accost hobos, harass chicks, kick tots into trashcans (I think). To cast Bök's anachronistic caca in ink is an arrant sin! So, I chant: Toss this book in a bin! Roast it on a stick! Crank it into thin carbon bits! Knit it into a cotton boa! Stash it in a rabbit’s ass! Bark at it! Bonk a banana on it! (or a carrot.) Kick it into orbit! Boo it! Cast it into Tarnation! Shoot at it: rat-a-tat-tat! Cart it into a hot cocoa bath (so as to stain it)! Boot it back to Toronto! Boot Bök (a Torontonian) back to Toronto too! Abstain! banish it! 
<!-- Christ, Bök is a host on Shark Tank??? -->
	
	AT A CASA BONITA:

	I scoot into a booth. <i>Christ, I thirst to ban this book. Or, to bar or banish it.</i> I snack on ricotta-nacho tacos as I knock back an absinth shot. Soon, I concoct an acrostic:

<div style="width: 100px; margin: auto">
<b>C</b>hristian:
<b>H</b>is
<b>R</b>ot
<b>I</b>s
<b>S</b>oon
<b>T</b>o
<b>I</b>nhabit
<b>A</b>
<b>N</b>ation

<b>B</b>ank
<b>O</b>n
<b>K</b>abobs
</div>

	Bank on kabobs? Ok, so this acrostic isn’t cast in iron. That as it is, I think Christian Bök is satan's incarnation, an anti-Christ, or both. I scan korans, torahs, archaic rabbinic books, archaic sanskrit arcana:

	<i>Rhinos... bonobos... bison... cats... cockatoos...</i> Oh, that's Noah's ark.

	Ah OK, this is it. A satan bit:

	<i>Satan... Shaitan... Tchort... Bök... Astaroth...</i>


	
	...BOK?????
	
	Oh. Oh no. Oh no, no, no. Not this! It's ironic, Christian ain’t so Christian.
<!-- too brisk -->
	Oh, “Bank on kabobs”- I think ISIS is in cahoots, to boot! This is a crisis- an ISIS crisis! I knock back a ninth absinthe shot.

	I can't sanction this, not a bit. So, I hatch an assassination tactic. In a cinch, I nab a Nissan hatchback. I sit carsick in transit as I shoot across Saskatoon, Cincinnati, San Antonio, Santa Ana, Boston, Ithaca (as an assassin, I can’t risk a short track, so I crisscross.) In Akron, Ohio I hit a raccoon and crash into a barn. I can’t start that car, so I hitch to a train (choo, choo!), hook to a boat’s anchor (toot, toot!), obtain a chariot (trot, trot!), ski on skis (ski, ski!), sit in a tractor (corn, corn!)... on to Toronto! <!--Chart a track -->
	
	At a tiki bar, I ask aboot Bök. I obtain corroboration that Bök is in his cabin on North Athabaska. So, I catch a cab (honk, honk). "To Bök's cabin, sir!" I chant. "Thanks!"

	AT BOK'S CABIN

	<div style="text-align: center;"><b>••••••••••••••</b></div>

	So, this is it. Bök's cabin. Christian sits in an assassin's crosshairs. I know it; Christian cannot.
	
	Knock? I think not.
	
	"IT IS I!", I roar. I crash into his cabin; bricks crack into bits. Christian Bök sits in a satin chair, in a cotton shirt, ascot, khaki shorts, a tan hat (so chic!)

	“THIS AIN’T KANSAS, TOTO!” I roar. In an instant, I attack. I stab a shank into his back- ribs crack as his torso's torn to torsions. Bök is a shish kabob! (Shish ka-Bök?) I stick scissors into his incisors in an inartistic incision- it’s cathartic. His throat is intact, so I thrash at it. I stick a tack an inch into his iris. I bash in his brains, so as to bask in his brain bits. A historic occasion- Christian Bök croaks.
	<!--  -->
	<i>Tick, tock, tick, tock…</i>

	I sit in shock. Christian is catatonic: abrasions anoint his skin, soon to scar. Thick stains taint his shirt (it ain’t Sriracha or Tabasco.) His aorta is torn to ribbons- no bacitracin, niacin or antibiotics can assist a boo-boo as harsh as that. Is this a trick? I think not. Horror sinks in. I catch a sob. “Oh, Christian- I cannot contain it!” Inhibitions shrink. Attraction throbs. I kiss Christian- his hair, his socks, his crotch. It’s so taboo, I can’t not. Soon, a sick kink kicks in- I thirst to inhabit Christian Bök, to soak in Christian Bök... to <i>absorb</i> Christian Bök. So, I toss his brain bits into a non-stick crock. As it starts to scorch, I stir in onion stock, cornstarch, tahini, harissa... it cooks into a brackish broth, akin to a risotto. As-is, it's OK on toast. TBH, I ain't a cook.
	<!-- his cock, his taint -->

	OK. This is too chaotic.
	
	Christian Bök isn’t hot, it’s a sin to think so. Nosh on his brains? Ick, no thanks. Bök is a carcass, that's that. I can’t backtrack, nor can I risk inaction- Toronto’s not an oasis, it shan’t harbor a crook. So, on an arsonistic kick, I torch his cabin. As it starts to char, I sit criss-cross, across a brook, in a rain-torn shack. Hot soot soars into orbit; it coats a birch branch. Bök’s cabin contorts into ash. Christian Bök is toast. I sob.

<div style="text-align: center;"><b>••••••••••••••</b></div>
	A notion took root, I think, at that Toronto cabin. A transition. As I think back on that occasion, I ask: is assassination OK?
	No. It is not OK. Assassination is a boorish, narcissistic act- not an act to boast on. I ain’t a saint; I sank to act on a barbaric instinct. I shat on a sacrosanct contract, I took a torch to a tacit oath. I shirk to think it! So. No sass, snark, or schtick: assassination is a no-no, OK? Arson too. That's it. Ok. Thanks.
