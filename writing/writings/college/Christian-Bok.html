<h1>Christian Bök:</h1><h2>A Critic’s Notations on his Book</h2><h3>(Written using only the letters in his name)</h3>

<!-- It has crass connotations
Its narration is scant, cartoonish, basic as ABC
It's too assonant, it's not consonant, its chart its scansions are scant
It's a scant to scan its scansions
its assonant to consonant ratio is
too brisk, too strict, too... assonant.

	Christian Bök’s book is shit. To start it is a task, to scan it is a strain. 
	Its narration is thin, its connotations are , It's scansions too scant, it's consonants too... inconsonant, I contract
	it abstractions, In short, it stinks.  

	consonants too inconsistant. it's as thin as hot air, as basic as A-B-C. 
	
	Is it ironic, satiric, or sarcastic? No, its irritation is intrinsic. This book is a bionic horror, a robotic abstraction: Bok, that contrarian, insists on chaotic constraints that constricts his inconsinant consonants into crass contortions.  This book isn't so-so; it is so, so, <i>so</i> so-so. It has no citations, it ranks on no charts, it's not canon. A kibosh on it! This isn't a book, it’s a non-book, an anti-book. I snort at it.
<!-- crass contrarian -->
	That as it is, Bök can't not scratch his ink nib- it's an inborn kink, a sick itch to scratch, a narcotic habit as chronic as crack, tobacco or cannabis. Not that it’s a knack- oh no. Bök isn't an artist. Bök's no Titian, Cassatt, Corot, or Bosch. Shit, Bök's no Bob Ross. Bok's book is to art as a cat's hiss is to Sinatra's croons, a rabbi's rich intonations/incantation, or a sonorant Bach cantata- it's a stark contrast.
	<!-- or soak it in inkhorn -->
	Bök is a hack, a batshit con artist, an anarchist kook, a contratian schnook, a baboonish brat, a Torontonian hick. 
	
	a tsi-tsi, and arrant irration.

	Bök is as skittish as an arthritic cockatoo, as brackish as a cockroach abortion, as hot as a bonobo in a bikini (AKA, not). To train Bök to concoct a book that’s not trash is to train a baboon to cook borscht.

	Oh, Bok is a 'bioartist' too. Ha! Bioart, AKA, not art.
	
	Bök’s book is a scab on a cock, a crab on a hot chick’s boob, a bacon stain on a koran (or torah).  
<!-- as ant is to a rhino thick cock- 
	To birth it is a sin
	or hashihs
	Not to nit,
	his thick hair
-->
	
<!-- Bök's no Bacharach, no OConnor. Tin-tin 
a batshit con artist, a toronto hick. baboonish
hashish tobacco crack 
A hick, a kook,  a bitch, batshit boorish
is that so?
-->
	Hint, hint: Bök’s book is on track to tank. I insist it is, so bank on it. Bök’s book is akin to “Titanic”, soon to sink, or a stock in bitcoin, soon to crash. Bök’s short stint in books is soon to hit a rock! Ciao, Christian! Bonsoir! Ta-ta! Thanks a ton (not!)

	Oh. Oh no. Oh no, no, no. NOOOOO!!! Bök’s book- it’s a hit?! It can’t- it is. Bök’s book stocks book racks in book chains across nations: China, Haiti, Costa Rica... Arabic nations (Iran, Bahrain)... on to Antarctica! Cancun to Cairo, Nairobi to Osaka, it's hot shit. This book has kickbacks, too: it's a boon to Bok's bankbook, a boost to his cash stash, a coin in his coin sack: Bok has stacks on stacks. Hot to trot, Bök hobnobs hotshot critics, or chitchats to bookish brainiacs at “Christian Bök-a-Thons”. Ooh, it irks! Bok is in hot rotation as an orator at rich rabbinic associations, Bok snacks on choco-croissants or raisin bonbons in chic bistros, as snobbish hosts toast Scotch, Kirsch or chianti as a hoorah to his book. Hoorah! Bök’s stock soars. That kiss-ass! Bök is a rockstar, an icon. Bok is so rich, ABC Shark Tank to cast Bok as a co-host on 'Shark Tank'; this boots Barbara Corcoran. Tarantino casts Bok as costar to Chris Rock in a hit horror-action-noir. This hoists Bok into an iconic strata: Britain anoints Bök (not British) “Sir Bök” in a historic coronation! Bök as an aristocrat? Oh, I abhor this- I abhor it so!
<!-- Aniston, Chris Rock -->
	I soak in rancor. Bök, a traitor to his nation, has no honor. Bök's book is a rash on this nation’s ass, a tarnish on this Christian bastion. His book is an initiation in anarchist antics- it stirs racist associations in hicks, cranks, or kooks; it's an incitation to riot. Soon, Bök-ian cohorts ransack train stations, accost hobos, harass asian chicks, kick tots into trashcans. To cast Bok's book, that anachronistic caca in ink is an arrant sin. So, I chant it: Abstain! Ban, bar or banish it! Toss Bök's Book in a bin! Roast it on a stick! Crank it into thin carbon bits! Knit it into a satin boa! Stash it in a rabbit’s ass! Bark at it! Bonk a banana on it! (or a carrot.) Kick it into orbit! Boo it! Cast it into Tarnation! Shoot at it: rat-a-tat-tat! Cart it into a hot cocoa bath (so as to stain it)! Boot it back to Toronto! Boot Bök (a Torontonian) back to Toronto too!
<!-- Christ, Bok is a host on Shark Tank??? -->
	
	AT A CASA BONITA:

	I scoot into a booth. <i>Christ, I thirst to ban this book. Or, to bar or banish it.</i> I snack on ricotta-nacho tacos as I knock back an absinth shot. Soon, I concoct an acrostic:

<div style="width: 100px; margin: auto">
<b>C</b>hristian:
<b>H</b>is
<b>R</b>ot
<b>I</b>s
<b>S</b>oon
<b>T</b>o
<b>I</b>nhabit
<b>A</b>
<b>N</b>ation

<b>B</b>ank
<b>O</b>n
<b>K</b>abobs
</div>

	Bank on kabobs? Ok, so this acrostic isn’t cast in iron. That as it is, I think Christian Bök is satan, an anti-Christ, or both.
	I ain't a historian, so I scan rabbinic books, archaic sanskrit, koranic arcana:
	<i>Satan... Shaitan... Tchort... Astaroth... Bök...</i>
	BOK??? Oh. Oh no. Oh no, no, no. Not this! Bök is Satan's incarnation? So it is... Christian ain’t Christian.
<!-- too brisk -->
	Oh, “Bank on kabobs”- I think ISIS is in cahoots, to boot! This is a crisis- an ISIS crisis! I knock back a ninth absinthe shot.

	I can't sanction this, not a bit. So, I hatch an assassination tactic. In a cinch, I nab a Nissan hatchback. I sit carsick in transit as I shoot across Saskatoon, Cincinnati, San Antonio, Santa Ana, Boston, Ithaca, Akron (as an assassin, I can’t risk a short track, so I crisscross.) In Wichita Kansas, I crash that hatchback into a barn. I can’t start it, so I hitch to a train (choo, choo!), hook to a boat’s anchor (toot, toot!), obtain a chariot (trot, trot!), ski on skis (ski, ski!), sit in a tractor (corn, corn!)... on to Toronto! <!--Chart a track -->
	
	In Toronto, I ask Torontonians aboot Bok. I obtain corroboration that Bök is at his cabin, on North Athabaska St. So, I catch a cab. "To Bok's cabin, sir! Thanks!" 

	<div style="text-align: center;"><b>••••••••••••••</b></div>

	So... This is it. Christian Bok's cabin. Christian is in an assassin's crosshairs. I know it; Christian cannot.
	
	Knock? I think not.
	
	"IT IS I!", I roar. I crash into his cabin; bricks crack into bits. Christian Bök sits in a satin chair, in a cotton shirt, tan ascot, khaki shorts, a hat (so chic!)
	
	"Oh... hi?"

	“THIS AIN’T KANSAS, TOTO!” I roar. In an instant, I attack. I stab a shank into his back- his torso is torn to torsions, his ribs crack. Bök is a shish kabob! No... a shish ka-Bök! I stick scissors into his incisors in an inartistic incision- it’s cathartic. His throat is intact, so I thrash at it. I stick a tack in his iris. I bash in his brains, so as to bask in his brain bits. A historic occasion- Christian Bök croaks.
	<!--  -->
	<i>Tick, tock, tick, tock…</i>

	I sit in shock. Christian is catatonic: abrasions anoint his skin, soon to scar. Thick stains taint his shirt (it ain’t Sriracha or Tabasco.) His aorta is torn to ribbons- no bacitracin, niacin or antibiotics can assist a boo-boo as harsh as that. Is this a trick? I think not. Horror sinks in. I catch a sob. “Oh, Christian- I cannot contain it!” Inhibitions shrink. Attraction throbs. I kiss Christian- his hair, his socks, his crotch. It’s so taboo, I can’t not. Soon, a sick kink kicks in- I thirst to inhabit Christian Bok, to soak in Christian Bok... to <i>absorb</i> Christian Bok. So, I toss his brain bits into a non-stick crock. It starts to scorch, so I stir in onion stock, cornstarch, tahini, harissa... it cooks into a brackish broth, akin to a risotto. As-is, it's OK on toast. TBH, I ain't a cook.
	<!-- his cock, his taint -->

	OK. This is too chaotic.
	
	Christian Bök isn’t hot, it’s a sin to think so. Nosh on his brains? Ick, no thanks. Bok is a carcass, that's that. I can’t backtrack, nor can I risk inaction- Toronto’s not an oasis, it shan’t harbor a crook. So, on an arsonistic kick, I torch his cabin. As it starts to char, I sit criss-cross, across a brook in a rain-torn shack. Hot soot soars into orbit; it coats a birch branch. Bök’s cabin contorts into ash. Christian Bök is toast. I sob.

<div style="text-align: center;"><b>••••••••••••••</b></div>
	A notion took root, I think, at that Toronto cabin. A transition. As I think back on that occasion, I ask: is assassination OK?
	No. It is not OK. Assassination is a boorish, narcissistic act- not an act to boast on. I ain’t a saint; I sank to act on a barbaric instinct. I shat on a sacrosanct contract, I took a torch to a tacit oath. I shirk to think it! So. No sass, snark, or schtick: assassination is a no-no, OK? Arson too. That's it. Ok. Thanks.
