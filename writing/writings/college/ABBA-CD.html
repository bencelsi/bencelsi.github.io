<h1>ABBA CD</h1><img src="../../gif/cd.gif"></img>

Agnetha, Benny, Anni-Frid and Bjorn:
Attractive, savvy, chic, and nonchalant.
A striking knack for music they did flaunt,
And just like that, from Sweden, stars are born.

And with their golden jumpsuits all adorned,
They gave the roaring crowds all they could want.
And yet their walk of fame was but a jauntâ€”
They split four ways their money and their scorn.

A cardboard box is curling in the sun.
Inside, a shattered disk and broken case.

Upon the disk, those ancient songs are spun,
Once sung by demi-gods with style and grace.

Their faces, once well-known, are known by none,
And lie face-down in some forgotten place.
