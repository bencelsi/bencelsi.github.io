<i>Each line is taken from the textbook “Modern Chemistry,” published by Holt, Rhinehart and Winston</i>



The year was 1848.
Russian scientist boldly predicted the existence and properties of
Chemistry.
Colorless, odorless and deadly
chemistry is the study of
Quantum theory.
Chemistry deals with questions such as,
what is the “cure” for cancer?
Chemists answer these kinds of questions in their daily work.
In September 1860,
Basic research, applied research and technological development
has reached the ‘awkward age.’
This made it nearly impossible for one chemist to understand
natural sciences.
An incredible achievement of this century,
a group of chemists
was studying the possible connections between
Marie Curie and Pierre Curie.
Their properties are strikingly similar.
When chemist Dmitri Mendeleev heard about the new
chemical formula,
imagine the confusion.
However,
if you were to taste it,
it is a grave mistake.
It was later discovered,
according to Albert Einstein,
the stomach produces
Nail polish removers.
According to Dalton’s atomic theory,
nail polish removers
is an imaginary gas.
These hot gases
is excreted by the kidneys.
They damage the ozone layer.
Boyle’s law
determine the color of the burst.
Checking the arithmetic shows that it is correct.
Therefore, we would expect
the deaths of hundreds of Americans every year.

So far, you have learned
what is chemistry?
The surprising answer is “none at all.”
