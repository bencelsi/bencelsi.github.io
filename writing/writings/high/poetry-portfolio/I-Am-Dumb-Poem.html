<h1 style="text-align: center;">I Am Dumb Poem</h1>
I am from poem?
I am dumb poem.
I am numb from an 'I am from' poem.
Since the fourth grade, four years foisted
Unfortunately not my forte
I forlornly forked four over
But those four, they were just foreplay.
For if you said those four were chill,
Then the fifth’s a doorway to Norway.
In other words, they’re super cool
‘Cause I’m at a new school,
That puts the old
Back in old school.

So forget I am from’s from childhood!
Now this is where I’m from,
From the gum under the chair
To the hair under the gum.
The odor of deodorant
Slowly erodes the walls
See fantastic hacky sackers
And flat plastic basketballs.

Yes, my school’s Cleveland high school!
It’s the only school in town
Where more people have purple hair
Than brown.
Rah-rah, Rasputin!
To greatness we aspire.
The students during fire drills
Secretly hope for fires.
I’m a warrior, hire a lawyer!
We hate ninety minute quarters
On the flip side, there’s an upside:
My long bus rides seem much shorter.

Now, I wasn’t born yesterday
But new I am this earth to,
For when I wake up at five,
It’s worse than being given birth to.
Yes, Cleveland high school’s my school!
But it seems a little strange,
The rules here are much easier to break
Than change.
I am from Portland Public Schools,
Ten years of it is showing.
Who cares about where I am from?
It matters where I’m going!
