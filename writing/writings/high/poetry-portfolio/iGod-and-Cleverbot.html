<h1><span class="igod">iGod</span> and <span class="cleverbot">Cleverbot</span></h1>

iGod and Cleverbot are two artificial intelligence programs that try to imitate human chat. iGod’s resposes are calculated by a pre-determined formula, so it can seem a bit more robotic and less human. iGod also thinks it’s God.  Cleverbot determines its responses by analyzing its huge history of human conversations. This means it can be more random and unpredictable, but it’s also closer to sounding human. Basically, they both just sound crazy. But when they talk to each other, we can see they are kindred spirits.
