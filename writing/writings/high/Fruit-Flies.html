    I’m sitting on a stool in an uncomfortable corner of my kitchen.  It’s a beautiful sunny day, but in here, it’s stuffy and overcast with the guilt of not being outside.  There is absolutely no poetic way to describe the dull light that falls on the dull surface of the dull counter.  At least there is a fruit basket, but not the kind that would make a pleasant painting.  It sits sadly between a bag of bagels and a hair brush.  Other than a few passable peaches, there's nothing at all romantic about its garlic cloves, browning bananas, lumpy pears, shriveled lemons, and long forgotten apples.
    Also on the counter is an elegant wine glass, which contains about an inch of pearly, orange wine.  Well, actually, only two-thirds of it is wine.  The bottom third is a dark, speckled, mass of fruit flies.  This glass was only set out a few days ago, and already it has reaped quite the harvest.  To fruit flies, apparently, alcohol trumps both honey and vinegar.  No matter how many flies are collected in the wine, however, there always seem to be more of them spilled out over the fruits and surrounding counter.  As I wave my hand over them, they jump off of their respective surfaces, hovering wildly.  Soon enough they get a hold of themselves and reluctantly settle into new spots.  They remind me of subatomic particles, bristling with charge, jumping from one electron cloud to the next.
    We've always had fruit flies, but the past few weeks have seen an outrageous amount of them.  Last week, I was getting some fruit and I snapped.  I grabbed the nearest applicable object (a college recruitment pamphlet) and went on a rampage, smacking as many of the little bugs as I could.  They swarmed thickly enough that by reaching forward, I could take them from the air without trying.  In retrospect, I realize, killing fruit flies out of anger seems at best pathetic, and at worst serial killer-y.  That encounter is the main reason I'm here to observe them.  In a way, I'm hoping to make a peace.  There are fewer of them here now than I expected, however, which is a bit disappointing.  Maybe I killed more than I remember?  Or, have they already evolved to avoid me?
    ALERT!  A fruit fly has landed on the inner rim of the wine glass.  He is facing diagonally downward, as if cocking his head at the sickly pool below.  Okay, screw the peace treaty, I am a serial killer.  I want to see this sucker succumb to the chalice of orange doom.
    He’s crawling now.  Down the glass.  Taking his sweet time.  He only walks diagonally, and frequently hesitates between zigs and zags.  Halfway down the glass, he stops.  Does he suspect?  Maybe he’s smart.  Maybe he’s wondering how the wine, clearly Sauvignon Blanc, got to be orange.
    ...And, he has turned around to crawl back up the glass, still zigzagging, still pausing.   It may just be human nature to personify random behavior, but I could swear that this fly is fraught with uncertainty, furiously debating himself over whether to trust the wine.  After making his third little trek back and forth, he has wound up directly across from where he started.  My jaw tenses.  At this point, he's testing my patience.
    Hold that thought.  There's a second fruit fly now.  This one just landed inside the upper rim, the same place where the first one started.  He's a little larger and a little paler, and a bit less trepidatious.  As he walks down the inside of the glass, he hops slightly with excitement.  He bypasses the halfway point completely, and comes to a stop just above the wine's surface.  I wait with baited breath.  Silence.  A moment and... he's off!  He flies in dangerously wobbly spirals around the inside of the glass.  His loopy victory lap of life is brought curtly to a close by the surface of the wine.  He struggles for a moment, wings flickering, and then he goes under.  I move quickly to get the best view.  Clearly suspended in the liquid, his hair-thin legs are in a graceful, slow-motion doggy paddle. He floats gently backwards.
    To a fruit fly, I think, drowning in wine is the absolute best way to go.  In fact, other than the drowning part, this oblivious fly is probably experiencing a euphoric sensory overload.  It must be nice, I think, to be dissolved in the concentrated epitome of your life's pursuit.  That said, the wine is cut with soap, to ensure that no fly drunkards get away.  In this moment, to this fly, all the pain and pleasure in the world comes down to a ratio of wine to soap.
    He has come to rest now, upon a bumpy, brown bed of friends.  He must not have been this close to so many of his own kind since he was a tiny egg, nestled in with his hundreds of siblings.  His legs are still paddling.
    The first fly has not moved.  This entire time, he has remained on the upper rim, a silent witness to the whole grim spectacle.  There is no expression on his face.  It’s as if he’s just watched himself die.
    If you do a google search on “do insects feel pain,” you will find a unanimous no.  Insects simply don’t have the necessary nervous systems or neurological structures.  Insects can’t even make their own decisions, as their behavior is entirely pre-programmed.  If a trail of army ants somehow form a loop, they will continue circling for days, swirling around in a crunchy black ring of futility, until they die of exhaustion.  They know only to blindly follow pheromones, with no concept of past or future.  Like the unthinking impulse of a computer, ants can be caught in infinite loops.   With such limited intellect, insects have neither the ability nor evolutionary inclination to feel pain.  Insects with missing legs, crushed wings, or stomachs chewed through by parasites will continue to eat, march, and mate, unphased and seemingly unknowing.  Being unable to recognize even your own broken body supposedly shows a lack of sentience, but if anything, an insects' earnest devotion to carry out a hopeless tasks only makes me empathize more.  Something about it seems rich with humanity.  To me, pain seems so fundamental to life that there must be a trace of it in even the most primitive creatures, the ones who have no way to express it.  But I also think I’m probably wrong.
    The first fruit fly turns around and crawls up the lip of the glass.  Perched on the edge, he now faces outward, away from the collective mass of his dead friends.  He is overlooking the edge of the counter.  To his dull little red eyes, he must be staring into what is a vast expanse, a deep canyon sprawled out dangerously beneath him, not the edge of a dusty kitchen counter.  He has no fear in the face of such enormity, of course, he can fly.  In this moment, he is the lone survivor and sole heir to an ancient, unbroken chain of death, but he doesn’t care.  He is content to balance on the edge of mortality, getting vicariously drunk off the alcoholic fumes of the dead.  And all the while, he keeps staring into the void.
    But of course, this is all just me falsely projecting humanity onto that pensive fly.  Why is he here?  Is he asleep?  Is he mourning for a deceased loved one?  What is he thinking?  Is he thinking anything at all?  Even if he has no consciousness, there must be something happening in his head, some pressure in his brain, urging him to stay or to fly.  He must be thinking something, right?  My own mind still can’t seem to wrap around the fact that maybe he doesn’t have one.
    It’s amazing how long he’s staying on that glass rim.  While I can’t help but shift my weight around, he hasn’t  so much as twitched for nearly twenty five minutes.  For a computer program, that’s an awful long time to go without performing any useful functions.  
    Time flies.  I must have looked away, because I glance back, and he’s gone.  My eyes dart around for him, but he was too fast. Fruit flies line the fruit basket; he has been engulfed by eternal anonymity.  He’s back to being barely a step above a speck of dust.  I wish I could have seen him go on his way, but I’m at least proud of him for making a clean getaway.
    I've been sitting here now for over forty-five minutes, which seems like enough fruit fly gazing for one day.  I’m getting hungry, so in what I think is a fitting end to my observation, I help myself to the nicest looking peach from the fruit basket.  As I pick it up, however, I realize that the bottom half is rotten.  A flurry of fruit flies erupt from between the fruits, and buzz around silently.  Gross!  So that must have been where they all were!  Of all the places to spend their fleeting lives, they chose the rotten side of a peach.  I take a few bites from the good side, walk outside, and lob the peach across the yard into the bushes.  For just a moment, fruit flies.
