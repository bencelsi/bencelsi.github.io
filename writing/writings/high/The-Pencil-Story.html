<h1>The Pencil Story</h1>
<img src="../../gif/pencil2.gif">
<i>Not long ago, I had an experience. Memories are fleeting in nature, nevertheless, I feel it is important to emphasize the truthfulness of this retelling.</i>
 
It is an entirely typical school day.  I’m sitting in what I believe was math class, no doubt taking full advantage of the opportunity to better myself through learning.  In an opportune moment, I sign myself out of class, and head off to the restroom.
I walk towards the sink.  I have absent-mindedly brought my pencil with me from class, so I place it on top of the paper towel dispenser and turn on the sink.  However, due to the slight angle of the top of the dispenser, my pencil begins to roll towards the wall.  I felt a jolt of adrenaline and grabbed for the pencil, but it was too late.  The pencil had fallen into the crack between the paper towel dispenser and the wall, and was now presumably trapped in the depths of that dark, dusty valley for which we have no name.
Pencils flow through my school like a kind of unimportant currency- unimportant, that is, until you find yourself without one.  I am now staring this increasingly real possibility in the face. Of course, I can always ask someone for a pencil, but that is a symbol of ultimate humiliation.  All of this is running through my mind as I finish washing my hands, taking my time, assessing my options.  I try to reach behind the dispenser, but the space is too narrow for my finger.  I look around for something roughly the right size, but the bathroom is remarkably bare.  If only I had a pencil.
I reluctantly roll up the paper towel that I just dried my hands with, begrudging myself, entirely sure I has no chance of success.  By squashing it flat, I can barely fit it behind the dispenser.  I swipe the paper towel like a credit card, across the length of the dispenser, and-
Two pencils clatter onto the floor.
My purchase has proved most profitable.  I stand there, staring at the floor in disbelief.  I have just witnessed, nay, performed, an unintentional conjuring.  With my wrinkly paper towel wand, I have done the impossible.  I have created something from nothing.
I reach down, and pick up the pencils.  To my relief, they do not vanish upon being touched.  One pencil seems completely normal, but the new pencil is green, and has the word “Jesuit” written on it.
Through  deductive reasoning, I realize a few things.  It seems that some other person, possibly with an affiliation to Jesuit High School, must have been here before me.  They too must have put their pencil on that inevitable slope, and they too must have faced a situation near identical to mine.  But somehow, they lacked the initiative to take back what was theirs, and now I have two pencils, while they have none.  
But this is not the end of the story.  Despite having already doubled my pencils, I was fully willing to look a gift horse in the mouth.  I put my eye up against the wall and peer into the dark crack.  Hidden to all but me, there is a gleaming pile of graphite and gold.  Three more pencils.  They could have been there for decades.
I can’t believe my good fortune.  In the space of a few seconds, I have gone from being bereft of any writing utensil, to the owner of a potential penta-pencil pack.  Remembering that I am now armed with a much more effective tool, I take a pencil and dig around behind the dispenser.  A pencil immediately flies out and lands in the corner, but I’m too in the moment to pick it up now.
​The two remaining pencils aren’t moving.  Why?  I crane my neck to make sure I haven’t miscounted, but sure enough, there are two pencils, nestled snugly between the wall and the dispenser’s plastic casing.  Again, I push them with my pencil, but they seem stuck.  I position myself at a different angle, trying to maximize my pencil contact.  How the mere power of gravity has so completely jammed these two pencils together in that narrow space leaves me baffled.  Nevertheless, overcome with primal desire, I push on, ever harder.  There is nothing to lose, and everything to gain.  
In the interest of accuracy, I have returned to this very location and measured the distance from the dispenser to the far wall.  I can say, without exaggeration, that the pencils flew 7 feet that day.

As I place the five pencils safely in my pocket, I realize the significance of what has just taken place.  In this unjust world I have stumbled across a small justice.  A tear forms in my eye, and I triumphantly emerge from the restroom, the astounding victor in a success of the human will. ​I return to the classroom, making sure to sign in.
