    <h1>Mister Oates</h1>
    <i>A long time ago, a young man went on a game show. The show was sponsored by a large oatmeal company known as Amish Oats, and although the man was chosen mainly because his last name was Oates, he miraculously went on to win the show’s top prize. He was awarded a lifetime supply of instant oatmeal, which was to be delivered to him once a month by the Amish Oats Oatmobile. He was overjoyed, but nobody realized the horrific consequences that would stem from that day.</i>

    Bitter winds howl in the cold black night. Rain pours from the sky and runs down a dusty hill, creating a filthy mud slide, dampening the prickly grass. A gravel road climbs the hill to its crooked peak. Here there sits a gigantic, ramshackle mansion, rattled by wind and ravaged by time. Weeds grow inside its crumbling walls, spiders crawl under its broken floorboards, and everything is consumed by a horrifying blackness. Although he can barely be seen, at the heart of this dark mansion sits an old man, even more ancient and decrepit than the mansion itself. A flash of lightning briefly illuminates his wrinkled face. This man is Mister Oates.
    Tonight Mister Oates can be found sitting alone in his dining room, eating oatmeal by candlelight. As he eats, he glances out the window. Where’s the Oatmobile? He grits his teeth in frustration. The Oatmobile is now three days late. It’s never been this late before, he realizes, panicked, oatmeal dribbling down his chin onto his black bathrobe. Although he’s very pudgy, his face is long and gaunt, and his crazy eyes glimmer in the darkness. Over the years, his repeated consumption of the bland breakfast food has deteriorated his mind, driving him to depression, isolation, and an intense hatred of all other foods.
    He finishes his oatmeal, and there is a loud thunderclap.
    “GET IN HERE, BOY!”
    His voice is raspy and slurred, but sure enough, a sickly old dog, whose diet also consists entirely of oatmeal, scurries into the room.
    “See this?” barks Mister Oates, picking up the empty bowl. “This is the last of the oatmeal!” He flings the bowl at his dog and begins pacing furiously, tugging at his white hair. Finally, he hobbles over to the front door and throws it open.
    “I MADE A DEAL WITH YOU,” he howls into the wind, his face immediately stung by rain. “WHERE IS MY OATMEAL, YOU BASTARDS!”
    He looks down the barren hill to the distant town below. Suddenly, a horrible thought crosses his mind. They must be trying to starve me! He feels a sinking in his stomach and a rising in his throat. They want me dead. He stumbles back into the mansion, tears in his eyes. Already he is craving oatmeal. The candle has been extinguished by the wind and everything is dark, but he can make out the shape of his dog sleeping on the ground. Although it is mostly skin and bones, he notices it has a very round stomach. His panic is replaced with maniacal desire. He pulls a kitchen knife out of his bathrobe pocket. I’ll get my oatmeal, he thinks, grinning to himself, even if I have to cut it out of you!
    He lunges at his dog, pins it to the floor, and starts cutting into its stomach. It lets out a loud yelp and wriggles free. It runs off and starts climbing a spiral staircase, limping slightly.
    “Come back, boy!” cries Mister Oates. He follows the terrified dog up the staircase into blackness, knife in hand. “I don’t bite,” he mutters under his breath as he stumbles after it, brushing away cobwebs, blind to all except the sound of whimpers and the smell of blood. His breath grows ragged, and his mouth waters at the thought of oatmeal as he climbs the darkened staircase ever higher.
    Finally he bursts outside onto a rickety old balcony, over fifty feet above the ground. His dog is lying curled up in a bloody heap. Rain crashes down upon them both. He grabs the dog by its neck, about to cut it open, when he hears the familiar sound of gravel crunching in the distance. He looks down and sees a beige van driving up the hill. The Oatmobile. It pulls up to the mansion, and a young man steps out.
    Mister Oates is purple in the face with rage. He tightens his grip on his dog, and then throws it down the staircase in frustration.
    “AAAAARRRRRGGGGGHHHHH!” he screams down at the man.
    The man looks around to find the source of the noise, then spots Mister Oates high up on the balcony. “Excuse me, are you Mister Oates?"
    “YES I’M MISTER OATES, YOU DEGENERENT HELLSPAWN! MY OATMEAL IS THREE DAYS LATE!”
    “I’m very sorry, sir, it won’t happen again.”
    “Do you realize,” seethes Mister Oates, visibly shaking with hatred, “that I nearly killed my dog because of you?”
    “I’m sorry, sir. Could you please speak up a little?”
    “I WILL HAVE YOUR HEAD, BOY!” he screams as he leans over the balcony. He’s about to say something else, but the rickety balcony suddenly crumbles beneath him. He scrambles to grab onto something, but it is too late. He falls, kicking and screaming, towards the hard ground below, and smashes into it with surprising force. Chunks of his body fly off in all directions, his frail bones shatter, and his innards splatter everywhere. The mansion, as well as the poor delivery man, are now covered in bits of Mister Oates.
    The delivery man stands in shock for a few seconds. A dog barks in the distance. “Gross,” he says finally, stumbling backwards, his face covered in the thick gunk. He wipes it off and is surprised to find that it is gray in color and mealy in consistency. Against his better judgement, he leans forward and licks some of it off his hand.
    “Well I’ll be darned,” he cries. “It’s oatmeal!”
