<h3>INT.  HOUSE - MORNING</h3>
<b>MACBETHA BLACK</b>
   An hour past the sunup, in this bright unbolted morn, you see, I quicken from transcendent dream.
   Yet in my sad unready state, once freshened I ascend the gait, and as I grize, addressed and prest, a craving’st pleached in my mind’s eyne?
   Quoth I, ‘must hath mine golden chalice, full-filled with mealy flaxen grain!’
   And as I gaze into thine air, thy present pass’ed into while-ere, whilst pin of present ticks again!
   Alas, ‘tis gone; whilst all art rushling hitherto from yon.
   But quick! ‘tis precious and ‘tis dear to swift’ly path to there from here, and tarry by a bus-stint near.


<h3>DISOLVE TO: EXT. BUS STOP - MORNING</h3>
<b>MACBETHA BLACK</b>
   And urgent though the moment seem, perchance to peer? ‘tis but a dream? but no, ‘tis right, mine eyne in flight, perhappenstance I spy a ging of juv’nal wights, mine inwards! In their merriment, they waft to me, and I to thee.
   Some seated in the frontal siege, whilst scantlings in the rear; they mop to me, too late, as I am but affright with fear...  My very nowl doth spring to wither: ‘how shalt thou choose, ‘tween yon or hither?’  O’erraught, bestraught, diffused, I see, to quip this quiddit green’ly, ‘twould make me quite the antick of the day.  ‘O, holp, O holp!’ quoth I, and as this torture’d hurtling burst from mine importing gulf, I slowly don the vastidity of this curs-ed dilemma; my fee-grief; ergo, its unavoided nature leaves me quite forspent:
   O, whefore shalt I sit, ye gods?  Pray, which siege shall be hent?

   ‘Tis the Friday; the Friday;
   For gaudy bergomask and many a brawl shall fall upon thy Friday, and the week’s end, ‘tis both foreseen and yearn’d.
   ‘Tis the Friday, the Friday
   For galliard and upspring-reel shall fall upon thy Friday! and the week’s end, ‘tis both foreseen and yearn’d!
   Partyeth; partyeth (Yea)
   Partyeth; partyeth (Yea)
   Joy!  Joy!  Hallelujah!
   The week’s end is prenominated!


<h3>DISOLVE TO: EXT. BACK SEAT OF CARRIAGE - NIGHT</h3>
<b>MACBETHA BLACK</b>
   ‘Tis bin three and forty minutes erewhile thy seventh hour pass’ed, though ‘or the cock-shut-time hath betid; very that time shalt pass fast! yet not quite so as our own self’s, our sprag ‘tis un-surpass’ed, alas.
   And as we art affear’ed of late, cruiseth o’er cobblestones betwith expedience quite’ly festinate, is our path both quick-swift and forthright? good-deed, for in this twilight-night;  the sands of time themself’s take flight!
   Ecstacy thick-pleach our minds, the thought of joy and fancy-free!
   Thou shalt know of it!
   For mine inheritance, ‘tis thine inheritance!
   Mine alder-liefest inward next my right, aye!
   For mine inheritance, ‘tis thine inheritance!
   Presently, ‘tis foreknown.

   Some seated in the frontal siege,
   Whilst scantlings in the rear;
   My pia-meter is forspent,
   Pray, which siege shalt be hent? O, dear!


<h3>DISOLVE TO: EXT.  PARTY NEXT TO HOUSE  - NIGHT</h3>
<b>MACBETHA BLACK</b>
   ‘Tis the Friday; the Friday;
   For lavolta and coranto shall fall upon thy Friday, and the week’s end, ‘tis both foreseen and yearn’d.
   ‘Tis the Friday, the Friday
   For all thou shalt equipage the fine merriment this Friday! and the week’s end, ‘tis both foreseen and yearn’d!
   Partyeth; partyeth (Yea)
   Partyeth; partyeth (Yea)
   Rejoice!  Rejoice in ecstacy!
   The week’s end is prenominated!

   All Thursdays must pass through nature and into eternity, exception that of last was not; ‘tis unproper and forthright, for ‘tis the quiddity of yesternight.
   Thou shalt not fret the backward-ends of time, for but a mome would’st come to sorrow.  Where’st lie the moment ‘tis of Friday? betwixt Thursday and the morrow.
   O, ye, ye, ye art so exciteth,
   Ye art exciteth
   Ye shalt roundel at the pomander to-day,
   The Sabbath Day, ‘tis on the morrow,
   And after this, the Lord’s Day cometh.
   O, why must the week’s end come to exigent? ‘tis both a-gainst and awkward to mine apprehensions!


<h3>DISOLVE TO: EXT.  FRONT SEAT OF CARRIAGE - NIGHT</h3>
<b>SIR PATRICIUS, SON OF WILL</b>
   Well-said, M.B., well-said! Macbetha Brach, and by this day!  She’s a fair lady.
   As I am seated, spring to quenching in the frontal siege,
   Perchance, methinks, the rear siege?
   I driveth; I cruiseth.
   Sprag roads; switcheth roads.
   A wagon, ‘tis affronted to me.
   Passin' by is a chargehouse-wagon; by what swinge-buckler is it driven?
   For the clock does jar eterne, I wish my hurtles to reverb! yet I repugn; I feel but tent.  My roisting rawness continent. My lunes hath turned to lumpishness, feel I franked and forweary, o, ‘tis dreary.
   But then, when at my flattest I find that to make me cheery, yes, and lustig in my fear!  For the day ‘tis that of Friday!  The week’s end, o, ‘tis of near!
   O, joy to all! we shalt hath a good time! come! come! come!


<h3>DISOLVE TO: EXT. ONSTAGE - NIGHT</h3>
<b>MACBETHA BLACK</b>
   ‘Tis the Friday; the Friday;
   For cinque pace and pavin, too shall fall upon thy Friday, and the week’s end, ‘tis both foreseen and yearn’d.
   ‘Tis the Friday, the Friday
   For passy-measure and wassail shall fall upon thy Friday! and the week’s end, ‘tis both foreseen and yearn’d!
   Partyeth; partyeth (Yea)
   Partyeth; partyeth (Yea)
   Rejoice!  Rejoice!  Hallelujah!
   The week’s end, ‘tis prenominated!
