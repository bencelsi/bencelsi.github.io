	<h1>Christian Bök</h1><h3>A Critic’s Notations on his Book</h3>
</div>
<div>
	Christian Bök’s book is shit. To start it is a task, to scan it is a strain. Its narration is as thin as hot air, as basic as ABC. In short, it stinks. Is it satiric? Sarcastic? No, its irritation isn't ironic. Bök's book is a bionic horror, a robotic abstraction- its constant constraints constrict its crass consonants into chaotic contortions. 
	
	As-is, Bök's book isn’t art. It's a stark conrast: Bök's book is to art as an ant is to a rhino, as a cartoon is to a cantata, as a cat’s hiss is to Sinatra’s croons. Bök’s book is a scab on a cock, a crab on a hot chick’s boob, a bacon stain on a koran (or torah). Bök’s book isn’t hot shit, it’s hot snot: as I scan it, I contract bronchitis. Ick! It has no citations, it ranks on no charts, it's not canon. A kibosh on it! This isn't a book. It’s a non-book, an anti-book. I snort at it.
<!-- as ant is to a rhino thick cock- 
	To birth it is a sin
-->
	That as it is, Bök can't not scratch his ink nib- it's an inborn kink, a sick itch to scratch, a narcotic habit as chronic as crack, tobacco or cannabis. Not that it’s a knack- oh no. Bök’s no artist. Bök's not a Tarantino, a Titian, or a Bob Ross. Bök's no Bach. Bök is a hack, a con artist, a batshit kook, an anarchist crank, a Toronto hick. Bök is as skittish as an arthritic cockatoo, as brackish as a cockroach abortion, as hot as a bonobo in a bikini (AKA, not). To train Bök to concoct a book that’s not trash is to train a baboon to cook borscht.

	Hint, hint: Bök’s book is on track to tank. I insist it is, so bank on it. Bök’s book is a  “Titanic”, soon to sink, or a stock in bitcoin, soon to crash. Bök’s short stint in books is soon to hit a rock! Ciao, Christian! Bonsoir! Ta-ta! Thanks a ton (not!)

	Oh. Oh no. Oh no, no, no. NOOOOO!!! Bök’s book- it’s a hit?! It can’t- it is. Bök’s book stacks stock book racks in book chains across nations: China, Costa Rica, Iran, Haiti... arabic nations (Iran, Bahrain)... on to Antarctica! Cancun to Cairo, it's a hit. This has kickbacks, too: it's a boost to his cash stash, a boon to his bankbook, a coin in his coin sack. Bök is rich. Hot to trot, Bök hobnobs hotshot critics, or chitchats to bookish brainiacs at “Christian Bök Book-a-Thons”. Ooh, it irks!  Bök has a nosh on choco-croissants or raisin bonbons in chic bistros, as snobbish hosts toast Kirsch to honor his book. Bök’s stock soars. 	That kiss-ass! Bök is a rockstar, an icon. Bok is cast as an actor, his histrionics  in hits (his costars? Nicholson, Hanks, Aniston, Hart, Brosnan Chris Rock) Britain anoints Bök (not a Brit) “Sir Bök” in a historic coronation! Bök is an aristocrat? Oh, I abhor this- I abhor it so!

	Bök, a traitor to his nation, has no honor. Bök's book is a rash on this nation’s ass, a tarnish on this Christian bastion. His book is an initiation into anarchic antics- it stirs racist associations; it starts riots. Bök-ian cohorts ransack train stations, accost hobos in rain-torn shacks, kick tots into trashcans. To cast this anachronistic caca in ink is an arrant sin- I can’t sanction it, not a bit. So, I chant it: Abstain! Toss Bök's Book in a bin! Roast it on a stick! Crank it into thin carbon bits! Knit it into a satin boa! Stash it in a rabbit’s ass! Bark at it! Bonk a banana on it! Or a carrot. Kick it into orbit! Boo it! Cast it into Tarnation! Shoot at it: rat-a-tat-tat! Cart it into a hot cocoa bath (so as to stain it)! Boot it back to Toronto! Boot Bök (a Torontonian) back to Toronto too!

	Christ, I thirst to ban Bök’s book. In a Casa Bonita, I snack on ricotta-nacho tacos. I knock back a ninth scotch shot as I think. Soon, I concoct an acrostic:

<div style="width: 100px; margin: auto">
<b>C</b>hristian:
<b>H</b>is
<b>R</b>ot
<b>I</b>s
<b>S</b>oon
<b>T</b>o
<b>I</b>nhabit
<b>A</b>
<b>N</b>ation

<b>B</b>ank
<b>O</b>n
<b>K</b>abobs
</div>

	Bank on kabobs? Ok, so this acrostic isn’t cast in iron. That as it is, I think Christian Bök is satan, an anti-Christ, or both. I scan Korans, torahs, Corinthians... Satan... Shaitan... Tchort... Astaroth... Bök... BOK??? Oh no. Not this. Bök is a Satanic incarnation. It's ironic- Christian ain’t so Christian.

	Oh, “Bank on kabobs”- I think ISIS is in cahoots, to boot! This is a crisis! An ISIS crisis!

	Soon, I hatch an assassination tactic. In a cinch, I nab a Nissan hatchback. I sit carsick in transit as I shoot across Saskatoon, San Antonio, Santa Ana, Cincinnati, Akron, Boston (As an assassin, I can’t risk a short track, so I crisscross.) In Wichita Kansas I crash that car into a barn. I can’t start it, so hitch to a train (choo, choo!), hook to a boat’s anchor (toot, toot!), obtain a chariot (trot, trot!), ski on skis (ski, ski!), sit in a tractor (corn, corn!)... on to Toronto!
	
	I ask Toronto's inhabitants aboot Bok. I obtain corroboration that Bök is at his cabin, on North Athabaska St. So, I catch a cab. "To Bok's cabin, sir! Thanks!"

	So... This is it. Christian Bok's cabin. Christian sits in an assassin's crosshairs. I can know it; Christian cannot.
	
	Knock? I think not.
	
	"IT IS I!", I roar. I crash into his cabin; bricks crack into bits. Christian Bök sits on a cot, in a cotton shirt, tan ascot, khaki shorts, a hat.
	
	"Oh... hi?"

	“THIS AIN’T KANSAS, TOTO!” I roar. In an instant, I attack. I stab a shank into his back- his torso's torn to torsions, his ribs crack. Bök is a shish kabob! No... a shish ka-Bök! I stick scissors into his incisors in an inartistic incision- it’s cathartic. I stick a tack in his iris. His throat is intact, so I thrash at it. As I bash in his brains, I bask in his brain bits. A historic occasion- Christian Bök croaks.
	<!--  -->
	Tick, tock, tick, tock…
	I sit in shock, in a catatonic stasis. Abrasions anoint Bök's skin, soon to scar. Thick stains taint his shirt (it ain’t Sriracha or Tabasco.) His aorta is torn to ribbons- no bacitracin, niacin or antibiotics can assist a boo-boo as harsh as that. Is this a trick? I think not. Horror sinks in. I catch a sob. “Oh, Christian- I cannot contain it!” Inhibitions shrink. Attraction throbs. I kiss Christian- his hair, his skin, his socks, his crotch... it’s so taboo, I can’t not. Soon, a sick kink starts to throb - I thirst to absorb Christian Bok. So, I hoist his brain into a nonstick crock, so as to cook it. It starts to scorch, so I stir in stock, cornstarch, tahini... it cooks into a brackish broth, akin to a borscht. As-is, it's OK on toast. I ain't a cook, TBH.
	
	OK. This is too chaotic.
	
	Christian Bök isn’t hot, it’s a sin to think so. To nosh his brains? Ick. Christian Bok is a carcass, that's that. I can’t backtrack, nor can I risk inaction- Toronto’s not an oasis, it shan’t harbor a crook. So, I act on an arsonistic instinct: I torch his cabin, it roasts in an instant. As it chars, I sit criss-cross in a rain-torn shack. Hot soot soars into orbit; it coats a birch branch. Bök’s cabin contorts into ash. Christian Bök is toast. I sob.
	<br>
<div style="text-align: center;"><b>••••••••••••••</b></div>
	A notion took root, I think, at that cabin. A transition. As I think back on that occasion, I ask: is assassination OK?
	No. It is not OK. Assassination is a boorish, narcissistic act- not an act to boast on. I ain’t no saint; I sank to act on a barbaric instinct. I shat on a sacrosanct contract, I took a torch to a tacit oath. I shirk to think it! So. No sass, snark, or schtick: assassination is a no-no, OK? Arson too. That's it. Ok. Thanks.
	
	Oh, to cook a cock brains in a crock, to nosh on it on toast? That's a no-no too.
