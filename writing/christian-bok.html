CHRISTIAN BÖK
A Critic’s Notations on his Book
</b>
</div>
	Christian Bök’s book is shit. To start it is a task, to scan it is a strain. Its narration is as thin as hot air, as basic as A, B, C. In short, it stinks. Is it sarcastic? Satiric? Ironic? No, it is an irritation. This book is a bionic horror, a robotic abstraction-– its constant constraints constrict its crass consonants into chaotic contortions. 
	As-is, it isn’t art. Bok’s book is to art as a cartoon is to a cantata, as an ant is to a rhino, as a cat’s hiss is to Sinatra’s croons (it’s a stark contrast.) Bok’s book is a scab on a cock, a crab on a hot chick’s boob. Bok’s book isn’t hot shit, it’s hot snot: as I scan it, I contract bronchitis. Ick! A kibosh on it! It has no citations, it ranks on no charts, it's not canon - this book isn't a book. It’s a non-book. I snort at it.
	<!-- as ant is to a rhino thick cock- 
		To birth it is a sin
	-->
	That as it is, Bök can't not scratch his ink nib- it's an inborn kink, a sick itch to scratch, a narcotic habit as chronic as tobacco or crack. Not that it’s a knack- oh no. Bök’s no artist. Bök is not a Tarantino, a Titian, or a Bob Ross. In short, Bok's no Bach. Bok is a hack, a con artist, a batshit kook, an anarco-satanist crank, a cannabis-hittin' Toronto hick. Ick! Bok is as skittish as an arthritic cockatoo, as brackish as a cockroach's abortion, as hot as a bonobo in a bikini (AKA, not). To train Bök to concoct a book that’s not trash is to train a baboon to cook borscht. 
	<!-- Bok's no Bacharach, no OConnor. Tin-tin 
	a batshit con artist, a cannabis-hittin' toronto hick.
	hashish tobacco crack 
	A hick, a kook,  a bitch,  batshit
	-->
	Hint, hint: Bök’s book is on track to tank. I insist it is, so bank on it. Bök’s book is as soon to sink as that “Titanic” boat, or a stock in bitcoin. Bok’s short stint in books is soon to hit a rock! Ciao, Christian! Bonsoir! Ta-ta! Thanks a ton (not!)

	Oh. Oh no. Oh no, no, no. NOOOOO!!!! Bök’s book- it’s a hit?! It can’t- it is. Bök’s book stocks book racks in chains across nations, across China, Costa Rica, Iran, Haiti...in arabic nations (Iran, Bahrain), on to Antarctica. Bok’s stock soars. This book has kickbacks: It's a boost to his cash stash, a boon to his bankbook, a coin in his coin sack. Bök is rich. Hot to trot, Bok hobnobs at hotshot critics, or chitchats to bookish brainiacs at “Christian Bök Book-a-Thons”. Bök snacks on raisin bonbons, knocks back chianti, or has a nosh on a choco-croissant. Snobbish hosts toast scotch shots to Bok’s book in chic bistros. That kiss-ass! Bok is a rockstar, an icon. Britain anoints Bök (not a Brit) “Sir Bök” in a historic coronation! Bök is an aristocrat? Oh, I abhor this- I abhor it so!

	Bok, a traitor to his nation, has no honor. This book is a rash on this nation’s ass, a tarnish on this Christian bastion, a bacon stain on a torah (or koran.) Oh, this book is an initiation into anarchic antics too- it stirs racist associations; it starts riots. Bok cohorts ransack train stations, accost hobos in rain-torn shacks, kick tots into trashcans. To cast this anachronistic caca in ink is an arrant sin- I can’t sanction it, not a bit. So, I chant: Ban Bok’s book! Toss it in a bin! Roast it on a stick! Knit it into a satin boa! Crank it into thin carbon bits! Stash it in a rabbit’s ass! Bark at it! Bonk a banana on it! Kick it into orbit! Boo it! Cast it into Tarnation! Shoot at it: rat-a-tat-tat! Cart it into a hot cocoa bath (so as to stain it)! Boot it back to Toronto! Boot Bök (a Torontonian) back to Toronto too!


	Christ, I thirst to ban Bök’s book. I sit in a Casa Bonita; I snack on carrot tacos or ricotta nachos as I think. Soon, I concoct an acrostic:
<div style="width: 100px; margin: auto">
	<b>C</b>hristian:
	<b>H</b>is
	<b>R</b>ot
	<b>I</b>s
	<b>S</b>oon
	<b>T</b>o
	<b>I</b>nhabit
	<b>A</b>
	<b>N</b>ation

	<b>B</b>ank
	<b>O</b>n
	<b>K</b>abobs
</div>

	Bank on kabobs? Ok, so this acrostic isn’t cast in iron. That as it is, I think Christian Bök is satan. Or, an anti-Christ. Or, both? I scan Corinthians. Satan… AKA Shaitan... Tchort... Astaroth o Bok… BOK??? Oh no. Bok is a Satanic incarnation, his birth . Ironic, Christian ain’t so Christian.

	Oh, “Bank on kabobs”- I think ISIS is in cahoots, to boot! This is a crisis! An ISIS crisis!
	So, I hatch an assassination tactic. In a cinch, I nab a tan Nissan hatchback. I sit carsick in transit as I shoot across Saskatoon, San Antonio, Santa Ana, Cincinnati, Akron, Boston (As an assassin, I can’t risk a short track, so I crisscross.) In Wichita Kansas I crash that Nissan hatchback into a barn. I can’t start it, so, I hitch it to a train (choo, choo!), catch a cab (honk, honk!), hook to a boat’s anchor (toot, toot!), obtain a chariot (trot, trot!), sit in a tractor (corn, corn!), ski on a ski (ski, ski!)... on to Toronto!

	I ask Toronto’s inhabitants aboot Bok. I obtain statistical corroboration that Bok is north, in his ranch cabin. North it is.

	Knock, knock. "IT IS I!", I roar. I crash into Bok’s cabin; bricks crack into bits. Christian Bök sits on a cot, in a cotton shirt, ascot, khaki shorts, a tan hat... this is it! Bök stirs; I attack. “THIS AIN’T KANSAS, TOTO!” I stab a shank into his skin- his torso is torn to torsions, his thin ribs crack. Bök is a shish kabob! No... a shish ka-Bök! Ha! This is a hoot. I stick scissors into his incisors in an inartistic incision- it’s cathartic. His throat is intact, so I thrash at it. As I bash in his brains, I bask in his brain bits. A historic occasion- Christian Bök croaks.
	<!--  -->
	Tick, tock, tick, tock…
	I sit in shock. Christian sits, in a catatonic stasis. Abrasions anoint his skin, soon to scar. Thick stains taint his shirt (it ain’t Sriracha or Tabasco.) His aorta is torn to ribbons- no bacitracin, niacin or antibiotics can assist a boo-boo as harsh as that. Is this a trick? I think it's not. Horror sinks in. I catch a sob. “Oh, Christian,” I croak. “I cannot contain it!” Inhibitions shrink. Attraction throbs. I kiss Christian- his hair, his socks, his crotch. It’s so taboo, I can’t not. I start to-
	<!--  -->
	NO. Christian Bok isn’t hot, it’s a sin to think so. Christian Bok is a carcass. I can’t backtrack, nor can I risk inaction- Toronto’s not an oasis, it shan’t harbor a crook. So, I act as an arsonist. I torch his cabin, it roasts in an instant. As it chars, I sit in a rain-torn shack. Hot ash soars into orbit; it coats a birch branch. Bok’s cabin contorts into soot. Christian Bok is toast. I sob.
<div style="text-align: center;"><b>••••••••••••••</b></div>
	A notion took root, I think, at that cabin. A transition. As I think back on that occasion, I ask: is assassination OK?
	No. It is not OK. Assassination is a boorish, narcissistic act- not an act to boast on. I ain’t no saint; I sank to act on a barbaric instinct. I shat on a sacrosanct contract, I took a torch to a tacit oath. I shirk to think it! So. No snark, no schtick: assassination is a no-no, OK? 
	<!-- Oh, arson too. -->
